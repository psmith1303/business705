## The current course

Why do yet another qualitative methods course? Many---and maybe even
most---universities offer qualitative research methods course. There
are also a plethora of textbooks on the subject. Then, there are a wide array of on-line resources; videos, web pages, and so on.

So, there has to be a question about why re-invent the wheel.

Part of the answer is about fitting the needs of our students as they
head into their dissertations and theses. Part of the answer is, that
I have tried to avoid reinventing anything. To that end, this course
is the result of the input of many people including Brigid Carroll,
Michael Myers, Cathy Urquhart, Margarita Mooney, and Ann Langley;
drawing on existing expertise and resources.

And so. I have tried to take their advice and ideas and synthesis something that
is a good fit for students in Management & International Business,
here at the University of Auckland.
