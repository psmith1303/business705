# Quick-start guide {-}

Welcome to the BUSINESS705, Qualitative Research Methods.

Over the coming six weeks, I hope that you will find this an engaging
and fun course.

My overarching goal for this course is to prepare you to undertake
your first (and perhaps only) research project of any size; e.g., a
masters (60-point) dissertation or an honours (30-point) dissertation.
This is my touchstone in all my thinking regarding BUSINESS 705. To
that end, I want you to be able to *select* qualitative research
methods that are *appropriate* for your chosen academic conversation
[@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication], and to *use* those methods
in a *proficient* manner.

This course guide includes details of
the [assessments](#assessment-overview), leading to
an [overview](#course-overview) of the course, and a list of
the [readings](#readings).

If you have not already done so, you should familiarize yourself with
the formal [course outline](#course-outline).

![warning](images/warning.png) In order to learn about qualitative
research methods, you will actually use a range of research methods
and techniques. In doing so, you will act both as an *investigator* in
research and as a research *participant*. Undertaking those dual roles
is a fundamental part of the course's design. Your enrolment in this
course is taken as your implicit agreement to the being a research
participant as explained in the [participant information sheet](#pis).


## Getting started {-}

1. Read how the course fits together
([assessments](#assessment-overview),
[course overview](#course-overview), and
the [course outline](#course-outline))
2. Print out the [To Do checklist](#todo-checklist) for the course.
   This will remind you of the tasks and milestones you need to meet
3. Get any [equipment you might need](#equipment)

Once you have done those four steps, you will be well positioned to be
successful in this course. If you have questions, please checkout
the [Frequently Asked Questions](#faq) chapter.

## Beyond the basics {-}

For those who are interested, there is information on the 'back story'
of the course. This includes:

1. How the course relates to the [MCom Postgraduate profile](#profile)
2. The [design decisions](#course-design) that guided much of what goes on
3. The [history of the course](#course-history)
