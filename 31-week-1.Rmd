# Week one {#w1-details}

Having successfully completed the research design course (BUSINESS
710), you already know a lot about doing research, and so, as we set
the scene this week _re_ qualitative research methods, many of issues
and ideas raised this week will be familiar to you.

But we will be going beyond 'just' reading and start practising some
to the tools and techniques of qualitative research.

## First class {-}

### Overview {-}

In this first session, we hit the ground running and find out about
you (as a academic) and your research interests (in terms of the
academic conversation in which you wish to participate).

Thinking about that participation, an important change that you may
have begun to notice is that staff increasingly treat you as junior
(academic) colleagues, rather than simply as students
[@breuer_2007_issueslearningteaching]; well, I certainly do. This has
many implications from expectations around your self-regulation
[@schunk_2005_selfregulatedlearningeducational] through to how you
present yourself as a researcher.

Qualitative research does not take place in a vacuum. It is shaped by
many factors [e.g., @huff_2009_designingresearchpublication p.86].
Consequently, it makes sense for you to have an understanding of how
those factors can affect your decisions vis-Ã -vis any qualitative
research you might undertake. So, the starting point of this course is
to surface your understanding of the academic conversation in which
you wish to participate (see the discussion on assumptions in Chapter
\@ref(course-structure)).


### Class plan {-}

* Welcome to BUSINESS 705

* As academics, what would be useful to know about one another?"
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
Go round the class and ask them to introduce themselves. Prompt: What 
does an 'academic' introduction look like?
```
* What do you want to know about the course?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
What questions do the students have about the course?
Note them on the white board if they are not answered immediately.
If they could reasonably know the answer, get the class to answer it.
```

* How are qualitative and quantitative research different?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE} 
This should focus on two levels;
epistemologically/ontologically, and on the practicalities of doing
the two types of research.

What does this mean for mixed methods
```

* What role will qualitative research play in your academic life?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
Split into groups of three or four, and discussion each others' research 
conversations. Which elements/factors matter the most re qualitative 
research methods?

How do the epistemological and ontological factors play out?
```
* What does ethics in  qualitative research look like?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
Question: if you undertake an auto-ethnography, are you required to get 
approval from UAHPEC?
```

### Prep and tasks {-}

Throughout this chapter---and also for subsequent chapters and
weeks---you should think of the tasks you need to complete as
'deliverables'; you should bring the product of you work to class in a
form that you can use and share with others; i.e., for each
deliverable, a single A4 page will usually suffice (it may comprise
notes, diagrams, mind maps, etc; whatever works for you and is
intelligible to your colleagues).

1. Review "Choosing an academic home"
  [@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication]
  &mdash; 30 minutes;

  - *Describe* the academic conversation to which you wish to make a
    contribution &mdash; 30 minutes.

  - Given the characteristics of your choose academic conversation,
    *discuss* the extent to which there are well understood patterns
    of research; i.e., is it the case that you are "in the midst of a
    conversation where many choices have been previously debated and
    an overarching agenda has been established"
    [@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication p. 87]. What are the
    implications of those patterns for the choice of methods in your
    conversation? &mdash; 60 minutes.
	  

2. Read "Part I" and "Part 2" of Myers
  [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness p. 3--56] &mdash; 120
  minutes.

  - *Summarise* the main 'big ideas' that underpin Chapter 2 of the
    textbook. What parallels, if any, are there with other books and
    articles you have read? &mdash; 20 minutes.
  
  - *Compare and contrast* the role of philosophic assumptions as
	presented by Myers [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness] and
	Huff [-@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication] &mdash; 40
	minutes.

3. The University of Auckland has a processes and policies around
   conducting research. One of the most important documents is
   entitled "Guiding principles for conducting research with human
   participants." A copy of these guidelines can be found on the
   University's website at:
   https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/research/re-ethics/re-uahpec.html.
   Read the "Guiding Principles for conducting research with human
   participants"
   [@theuniversityofauckland_2013_guidingprinciplesconducting] &mdash;
   40 minutes.

   - *Discuss* the relationships that exist---or their lack---between
	  Myers [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness], Huff
	  [-@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication] and the University's
	  "Guiding principles ..." with regard to ethics in conducting
	  research &mdash; 20 minutes.

## Second class {-}

### Overview {-}

In this class we move from talking about qualitative research into
actually practising with some of the tools and techniques; and in
particular doing some interviewing (and hopefully, a lot of doing).

Looking at the big-picture, you need to work out how interviewing fits
(or does not fit) with your epistemic/ontological position. And, if it
does fit, in what way does it fit. At a gross level, how you go about
doing an interview---say, the types of questions--will change
depending on how critical/interpretivist/positivist is your stance.

### Class plan {-}

* What questions and comments do you have arising from the first class?

* Where do you place yourself and the research conversation that you
  are interested in? Positivist, interpretivist, critical, something
  else? 
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
In terms of it being positivist (yes,
  one can do positivist qualitative research; see chapter 1 of the 4th edition of The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research **DENZIN 2011 REF**), interpretivist,
  critical, or something else?
  
Does the 'criticality' of your stance impact on the ethical
requirements of the University of Auckland.
```
* In small groups, who has the best interview guidelines for the structured interview?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
What makes it good?
What was a problem? (e.g, how long should the interview take?)
The do it again, with the semi-structured guidelines. 
```
* How easy is it to do a structured interview?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
In groups of 3 (or 4), one person be the interviewer, one the interviewee, the others being the observers. 
Debrief the quality of the process (not the content of the interview).

Not if anyone doesn't want to be a participant, they can limit themselves to being observers.
15 + 5 minutes.
```
* How easy is it to do a semi-structured interview?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
In new groups of 3 (or 4), one person be the interviewer, one the interviewee, the others being the observers. 
Debrief the quality of the process (not the content of the interview).

Note if anyone doesn't want to be a participant, they can limit themselves to being observers.
15 + 5 minutes.
```
* How does note-taking versus recording impact the interview process?
```{theorem, echo=FALSE}
Do an unstructured interview on the topic of "The pros and cons of public transport in Auckland"

First interview, do it with note-taking but not recording.

Do an unstructured interview on the topic of "The best techniques for writing an essay"

This time record the interview using a recorder.

What are the pros and cons of each (and both)

```
* Looking ahead to your learning journals, are you clear what you need
  to do (as opposed to being clear as to what you will do --- ends and
  means).

### Prep and tasks {-}

1. Read chapter 9 of Huff [-@huff_2009_designingresearchpublication]
   &mdash; 20 minutes.
   
   - *Identify* the likely types of goals when using interviews, for
     positivist, interpretivist, and critical research &mdash; 40
     minutes.


2. Read the start of "Part IV" of Myers
  [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness p. 117--135] &mdash; 60 minutes.
  
3. *Develop* a script [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness p. 129]
   (including an interview guide) for a structured interview on the
   topic of "The difference between interpretivist, positivist, and
   critical forms of research" &mdash; 30 minutes.

4. *Develop* a script (including an interview guide) for a
   semi-structured interview on the topic of "The most useful article

5. Explore the 'little blue books' at SAGE research methods site
   http://methods.sagepub.com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/.
   - Select one book that focuses on interviewing; spend an hour skim
     reading, and then *summarise* the book &mdash; 90 minutes.

6. Use the SAGE research methods site again, and find "The SAGE
   Handbook of interview research: The complexity of the craft" and
   read Chapter 15 [@wang_2017_sagehandbookinterview] &mdash; 60
   minutes.
   
   - *Identify* that chapter's main message &mdash; 10 minutes.
   
7. Having done tasks 4--6, do you need to revise your interview
   scripts (yes/no)? &mdash; 10 minutes.

## End of week {-}

With the week's classes behind you, it is time to do your learning
journal (Section \@ref(ass1) &dash; 60 minutes) and then do your
review the learning journals of your peers (Section \@ref(ass1) &dash;
60 minutes).
