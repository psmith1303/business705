# Week four {#w4-details}

The data collection tools we have explored thus far---interviewing,
focus groups, participant and non-participant observation, and
document collection---can (and are) fruitfully employed the research
methods of action research and case studies. You will find that these
tools have their uses in ethnographic research (this week) and ground
theory (next week).

Following on from your excursion into thematic analysis, this week you
will be taking a deeper dive into hermeneutics and semiotics.

However, so far, the course has centred on taking research methods
(and various tools of conducting qualitative research) and looking at
individual parts; e.g., case studies have been considered somewhat
separately to interviewing. Thus far, this has led to a rather general
understanding of the topics of the first half of the week. For
example, how interviewing fits with something like ethnographic
research---in particular---has not been considered.

For the remainder of the course, the goal is to start to integrate the
components that, until now, we have been treating a separate and
distinct.

## First class {-}

* How is interviewing (in general) different to ethnographic interviewing?

* What is the reason for those changes?

* How have Smet/Jarzabkowski and colleagues addressed the adavantages
  and disadvantages of ethnographic research?

### Overview {-}

### Class plan {-}

* Ethnographic research


### Prep and tasks {-}


1. Read Chapter 8 of Myers
  [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness p. 92--103] &mdash; 30 minutes.

2. Draw a concept map that distinguishes/highlights the differences
   between interview (as you currently understand it) and
   ethnographic interviewing (hint: you might find something useful
   in the Handbook of Ethnography on the SAGE Research Methods
   website &mdash; 45 minutes.

3. Review the notion of transferability on the SAGE Research Methods
   website &mdash; 30 minutes.

4. Read Smets _et al_., [@smets_2015_reinsurancetradinglloyd] and the
   the complimentary article by Jarzabkowski and colleagues
   [@jarzabkowski_2015_conductingglobalteambased] &mdash; 60 minutes.

5. The _quid pro quo_ of that research was primarily an industry
   report which can be found at  https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/research_showcase/Smets-lloyds/beyond-borders-resinsurance-industry-cass-knowledge.pdf. Skim the report &mdash; 15 minutes.
   
   
6. Be prepared to answer the following questions regarding the aforementioned research:

   - What was the over-arching research method?
   - How was data collected?
   - How was the data analyses?
   - How much work the academic research probably took?
   - How much work the industry report took?
   - Evaluate the quality of their research.
   - How have they achieved transferability?
   - And any other insights about their approach they went about doing
     qualitative research in that project &mdash; 60 minutes in total.

7. Go to Google Scholar and search for "smets reinsurance", skim the
   articles. How many publications (and over what period) can you identify that
   Smet/Jarzabkowski and colleagues produced from their ethnographic
   data set? &mdash; 30 minutes.
   
8. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of ethnography research
   identified by Myers. How do you see those playing out in the work
   of Smets/Jarzabkowski and colleagues? &mdash; 30 minutes.

## End of week {-}

With the week's classes behind you, it is time to do your learning
journal (Section \@ref(ass1) &dash; 60 minutes) and then do your
review the learning journals of your peers (Section \@ref(ass1) &dash;
60 minutes).
