# Postgraduate profile {#profile}

## Preamble
The University of Auckland has developed a collection of Graduate
Profiles for students in postgraduate level programmes that expresses
an aspiration for its graduates through a set of university-wide
attributes and values which it considers to be attainable by graduates
of a leading research university. They communicate to current and
potential students and faculty, employers, the community, and other
academic institutions the qualities that The University of Auckland
seeks to impart to, or foster in, its graduates. The Graduate Profiles
that have been developed are for: (i) Postgraduate Coursework
Graduates; (ii) Postgraduate Research Graduates (masters level or
equivalent); and (iii) Doctoral Graduates.

The University of Auckland is committed to provide an educational
experience of the highest standards to its students. In addition, The
University of Auckland recognises the needs of a diverse and
multi-cultural student population, including its special
responsibility under Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi.

The implementation of the Graduate Profiles rests with the faculties,
departments, and other teaching and learning support divisions of the
University, which may develop more specific profiles that are suitable
for their subject fields and/or student population. As the student
learning environment changes, the Graduate Profiles will be reviewed.

## Description

The following six themes represent the capabilities that the Business School seeks to foster
in all of its graduates. The development of these capabilities does not come all at once, but
rather is expected to build from year to year. Each course is not expected to contribute to
all capabilities, but each course will have its own goals and learning outcomes that relate
to the overall development of this profile.

1. *Disciplinary knowledge and practice:* Graduates will be able to
apply highly specialised knowledge within the discipline to
demonstrate an advanced awareness and understanding in a global
context.

2. *Critical thinking:* Graduates will be able to analyse and evaluate
the relevant literature, and design and develop scholarly arguments
that demonstrate advanced and diverse thinking.

3. *Solution seeking:* Graduates will be able to creatively research
and analyse complex issues, and develop innovative solutions.

4. *Communication and engagement:* Graduates will be able to engage,
communicate, and collaborate with diverse groups using multiple
formats and effectively address a range of professional and academic
audiences.

5. *Independence and integrity:* Graduates will be able to demonstrate
advanced independent thought, self- reflection, ethics, and integrity.

6. *Social and environmental responsibility:* Graduates will consider,
in relation to their discipline, the potential significance of the
principles underpinning both the Treaty of Waitangi and
sustainability.
