## Research in BUSINESS 705

There is old saw says that *practice makes perfect*. As this course is
about qualitative research methods---and in particular, about preparing
you to undertake your own research in the future---an important part of
this course is actually doing the stuff of qualitative research. To
build your skills in this area, you will practice common qualitative
research techniques. For example, you will design an interview
guide and then conduct interviews using that guide. 

More formally, you will act as an *investigator* and actually use
the tools of qualitative research to collect data from your classmates; this
implies that you will also act as a *participant* when it is the turn of
your classmates act as investigators.

As a participant, you need to be fully informed about the consequences
of your participant in the research activities that will take place
within the BUSINESS 705 classroom. The remainder of this chapter
explains the research activities that will take place in BUSINESS 705.

## The nature of your participation

As detailed in the Chapter \@ref(assessments), a significant method of
assessing your learning is through a (reflective) auto-ethnography
centred the nature of your learning about qualitative research
methods. As a form of participant observation, auto-ethnography
combines the roles of investigator and participant. Thus being an
investigator and as a participant are integral parts of this course.
Your enrolment in this course is taken as implicit consent to this.

As part of your auto-ethnography you will be party to:

 * Participant and non-participant observations
 * Interviews
 * Focus-groups
 * Questionnaires
 * Repertory Grids

Given that you will be doing participant observation, everything that
you, and your peers, do and say in the class---either formally or
informally---may become data.

At times your participation may be recorded (either by video or by
digital audio). This is so you can compare and contrast the impact of
recording (versus note taking) both from the perspective of the
participant and that of the investigator. 

You should assume that everything you do and say in the class may be
recorded; as novice researchers it is possible that someone (when
acting as an investigator) neglects to notify participants that they
are being recorded.

## Purpose of the research

The primary purpose of the research activities in BUSINESS 705 is to
give you and your peers the opportunity to practice techniques of
qualitative research. There is no intent on my part that the data
collected will intended to lead to a published output, say, a journal
article.

The research question that frames activities in which you will
participate is "My learning of qualitative research methods".

## Location of the research

You will only be acting as a participant during the scheduled class
time of BUSINESS 705.

## Confidentiality

Given the nature of the class, it is not possible to promise
confidentiality around either your participation in general, or your
data in particular. Your classmates will know that you are 'in the
class', they will see, for example, the interviews in which you
participate, and thus everyone in the class will---to some degree or
other---have access to the data that is elicited from one other.

## Potential risks

Give the topic of the research activities, and the nature of those
research activities, it is anticipated that there are no potential
risks that are materially different from any other class where you
might be required to keep a learning journal, or other reflective
pieces of work.

## Data retention

You should be aware that the data collected by your peers may be
retained by them (as part of their auto-ethnography) indefinitely.
