Welcome to the BUSINESS705, Qualitative Research Methods.

Over the coming six weeks, I hope that you will find this an engaging
and fun course.

My overarching goal for this course is to prepare you to undertake your
first (and perhaps only) research project of any size; e.g., a masters
(60-point) dissertation or an honours (30-point) dissertation. This is
my touchstone in all my thinking regarding BUSINESS 705. To that end, I
want you to be able to \emph{select} qualitative research methods that
are \emph{appropriate} for your chosen academic conversation
\autocite{huff_2009_designingresearchpublication}, and to \emph{use}
those methods in a \emph{proficient} manner.

This course guide includes details of the
\protect\hyperlink{assessment-overview}{assessments}, leading to an
\protect\hyperlink{course-overview}{overview} of the course.

If you have not already done so, you should familiarize yourself with
the formal \protect\hyperlink{course-outline}{course outline}.

\includegraphics{images/warning.png} In order to learn about qualitative
research methods, you will actually use a range of research methods and
techniques. In doing so, you will act both as an \emph{investigator} in
research and as a research \emph{participant}. Undertaking those dual
roles is a fundamental part of the course's design. Your enrolment in
this course is taken as your implicit agreement to the being a research
participant as explained in the \protect\hyperlink{pis}{participant
information sheet}.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\section*{Getting started}\label{getting-started}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Getting started}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Read how the course fits together
  (\protect\hyperlink{assessment-overview}{assessments},
  \protect\hyperlink{course-overview}{course overview}, and the
  \protect\hyperlink{course-outline}{course outline})
\item
  Print out the \protect\hyperlink{todo-checklist}{To Do checklist} for
  the course. This will remind you of the tasks and milestones you need
  to meet
\end{enumerate}

Once you have done those four steps, you will be well positioned to be
successful in this course. If you have questions, please checkout the
\protect\hyperlink{faq}{Frequently Asked Questions} chapter.

For those who are interested, there is information on the `back story'
of the course. This includes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  How the course relates to the \protect\hyperlink{profile}{MCom

\item
  The \protect\hyperlink{course-design}{design decisions} that guided
  much of what goes on

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The toolbar}

If you are using the website version of this e-book, you should see a
toolbar at the top of the screen, see Figure \ref{fig:toolbar}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{images/toolbar} \caption{The Bookdown toolbar}\label{fig:toolbar}
\end{figure}

The first `button' turns the table of contents display on and off.

The second button allows you to search the contents of the book.

The third button, looking like a letter A, controls the styling of the
page, changing the type of font, its size, and the colour palette of the
page.

The next button allows you to edit the content of the book. More
correctly, it takes you to a copy of the source of this book on
\href{https://www.github.com}{GitHub}. If you have a GitHub account you
can then make changes to the book, for example, if you want to fix a
typo.

The final button allows you to download either a PDF or an epub version
of the book in its entirety.

\hypertarget{the-social-bar}{%

On the website version of this e-book, there are buttons to allow you to
share details of the book on Twitter, Facebook, etc.

\begin{quote}
For most students, assessment requirements literally define the
curriculum. \autocite[ p.~7]{james_2002_assessinglearningaustralian}
\end{quote}

There are four types of assessment in this course:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llr@{}}

\hypertarget{assessment-due-dates}{%
\section{Assessment due dates}\label{assessment-due-dates}}

There is no final examination; all the assessment takes place during the
six weeks of the course. If the class, \emph{as a whole}, thinks the
dates for the learning journals and peer reviews need to be moved around
a bit, then we can do that during week 1.

At the completion of this course you should be able to \emph{select}
qualitative research methods that are \emph{appropriate} for your chosen
academic conversation \autocite{huff_2009_designingresearchpublication},
and to \emph{use} those methods in a \emph{proficient} manner.

In other words, by the end of this course it is expected that you will
be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  select qualitative research methods that are appropriate to the
  research conversation in which the student wishes to participate;
\item
  be proficient in use tools and techniques in qualitative research;
\item
  effectively communicate the findings arising from qualitative
  research;
\item
  justify the choices made around the collection, analysis, and
  presentation of qualitative data, congruent with your chosen research
  conversation.

\item
  To help with your sense making
  \autocite{weick_1995_sensemakingorganizations} regarding this course.
\end{itemize}

A casual search using Google Scholar for learning journals provides a
plethora of articles extolling their virtues. Broadly, learning journals
foster high quality self-reflection and increase critical thinking.

You are to maintain a learning journal. Later, you are to use the your
journal entries as the `data' for a \protect\hyperlink{ass4}{summative
learning journal}/essay on your major learnings from this course.

\hypertarget{task-overview}{%
\subsection*{Task overview}\label{task-overview}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Task overview}

During the course you are to write 10 learning journals of at least 400
words. The more you write the more grist you will have for your
\protect\hyperlink{ass4}{summative learning journal}.

In each of your learning journal entries, you are to explore the
linkages between the theoretical content of the course; e.g., the
readings and class sessions with your practical experience e.g., doing
and using qualitative research tools and techniques. As well as content
(theory) from this course, you may, if appropriate, draw on material
from other courses; indeed, you should make linkages to BUSINESS 710.

Ultimately, you should be considering the real difference the course is
making to your thinking and behaviour around qualitative research.

\hypertarget{what-does-a-good-learning-journal-look-like}{%
\subsection*{What does a good learning journal look
like?}\label{what-does-a-good-learning-journal-look-like}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{What does a good learning journal look
like?}

Let's begin by looking at the common problems. Based on experience with
previous classes, the main problems are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Many journals do not have a logical structure; the approach
  recommended by Daudelin
  \autocite*{daudelin_1996_learningexperiencereflection}, should be your
  model. Using Daudelin's method is the one most significant changes
  that most people could make when trying to improve their learning
  journals.
\item
  When using theory in their journals, people often use it to label
  things; e.g., `Interviews with more than two people are often called
  focus groups'. Very few (if any) people are using theory to either
  explain what is happening, or predict what might happen.
\item
  This is closely tied to the focus of some journals (i.e, not
  substantively addressing a real issue). I think that this partly
  because people aren't drawing on particular theory to address a
  particular problem; instead they are drawing on the `theory of the
  week'. I really encourage you to use Daudeline's approach, select
  theory that supports that issue (and that won't necessarily be theory
  of the week).
\item
  Finally, many journals read like a `stream of conscious', rather than
  a considered (and edited) reflection upon the week's learning and
  writing up that reflection. Like any good piece of writing, learning
  journals benefit from going through a process of drafting and review.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ass2}{%
\section{Peer review of learning journals}\label{ass2}}

\hypertarget{task-objectives-1}{%
\subsection*{Task objectives}\label{task-objectives-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Task objectives}

Reflexivity---as distinct from reflection
\autocite{hibbert_2010_reflexivityrecursionrelationality}---is an
important characteristic of qualitative research and its researchers
\autocite{haynes_2012_reflexivityqualitativeresearch}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Through evaluating and commenting on the reflections of your peers,
  this assignment seeks to engender greater reflexivity.
\item
  To provide developmental feedback on your peers' thinking about their
  stance and approach to qualitative research.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{task-overview-1}{%
\subsection*{Task overview}\label{task-overview-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Task overview}

Each week you must review, provide feedback on, and evaluate the
learning journals of two of your colleagues. Over the course you will
write 20 sets of feedback. Your primary goal in providing feedback is to
help the author do a better job next time. If you feedback does not
achieve that, then the author can rightly complain about the quality of
your feedback (and that will affect your marks).

The feedback should, as a minimum, address:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How well the journal meets the guidelines provided by Daudelin
  \autocite*{daudelin_1996_learningexperiencereflection}.
\item
  The extent to which the journal demonstrates achievement in the higher
  levels of Bloom et al.'s
  \autocite*{bloom_1956_taxonomyeducationalobjectives} taxonomy of the
  cognitive domain.
\item
  The quality of the writing.
\end{itemize}

In all cases, you should suggest how they might improve their journal;
it is insufficient to point out the weaknesses in their journal without
providing specific actionable ways they might improve. For example, it
is not good enough to say, ``Check your grammar''. Rather you explain
the nature of the problem and how they might fix it. Having said that,
items like grammar and spelling are `hygiene' factors---you should first
provide feedback on more material aspects of journals, and then move on
to the smaller matters (if warranted).

That being said, the secondary goal---and a characteristic of the best
reviews--is to foster the development of greater reflexivity in your
peers' and your own approach to qualitative research.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Build on the weekly learning journals to enable an integrative
  reflection of your learning across the whole course.
\item
  To demonstrate what you regard as being most important in being a
  qualitative researcher.
\item

This final part of the assignment is a summative evaluation of your
weekly journals. Drawing on your weekly journal entries, you are to
write a final, summative journal entry of at least 2,000 words.

Your summative learning journal is quite different to your weekly
learning journals.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It should focus on something that you have learnt throughout the
  course and demonstrate what you can do better now than what you could
  do before the course.
\item
  It must demonstrate the breadth as well as the depth, of what you have
  learnt.
\item
  It should provide good evidence of both evaluation and synthesis
  \autocite{bloom_1956_taxonomyeducationalobjectives}.
\item
  It should be based on the `data' from your weekly learning journals,
  and possible insights you have had as a result of providing feedback
  on others' learning journals; you may also draw on other writing you
  have done for this course..
\item
  It will probably focus on one or two major takeaways/insights. Maybe
  three, certainly not five. These are the things that have changed the
  way you think about qualitative research methods and changed your
  (planned) behaviour.
\item
  The summative journal should not focus on being too personal about
  your experiences throughout the course, but instead focus on how you
  can apply your learning in the future.
\end{itemize}

You should strive to demonstrate how you meet the
\protect\hyperlink{learning-objectives}{learning objectives} of this
course, in the context of the \protect\hyperlink{profile}{postgraduate
profile}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For many in the class, this is the first time they will have had to
  undertake reflective writing. As a result, some people will approach
  this assignment with some trepidation. For those people, the article
  by Daudelin \autocite*{daudelin_1996_learningexperiencereflection}
  will provide assistance. As you progress, you should find writing
  journals increasingly easy and natural. As a result, your later
  journals may be considerably longer than your earlier ones. Because of
  this, there is no upper word limit for your weekly journal entries.
\item
  In your learning journals, it is normal and acceptable to use the
  first person (e.g., I, me, etc.).
\item
  The quality of your writing matters.
\item
  Failing to correctly cite/reference material in your journals can
  incur a minimum 10-percent penalty being applied to your summative
  learning journal. You should correctly cite your weekly learning
  journal using an APA formatted references.
\item
  If it looks like you have `blown off' doing the weekly learning
  journals it is impossible to get a passing grade for the summative
  learning journals.
\item
  In this context, meaningful feedback means that the recipient can
  unambiguously use it to improve their work within the guidelines
  provided (in the opinion of the recipient, other classmates, or the
  teaching staff). If you feel unhappy about the quality of the feedback
  you receive from your peers, let the teaching staff know.

I want you to participate so that you can learn from each other. Good
participation is known to increases what is remembered, how well it is
assimilated, and how the learning is used in new situations. Through
participating, you will clarify your own thinking about the content of
the course, and you will provide your peers with the opportunity to
provide constructive feedback, further deepening your understanding of
the material. Likewise, in listening to, and responding to, the
participation of others, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate
alternate ways of interpreting and applying class material. In a course
like this, that stresses the application of material, extensive
participation an essential element of students' learning and of the
classes success.

\hypertarget{grading-participation}{%
\subsection*{Grading participation}\label{grading-participation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Grading participation}

I am a holistic marker, and each class, I will evaluate your
participation using the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Outstanding Contributor} (3): Contributions in class reflect
  exceptional preparation. Ideas offered are always substantive, and
  provide one or more major insights as well as direction for the class.
  Challenges are well substantiated and persuasively presented. If this
  person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would
  be diminished markedly.
\item
  \emph{Good Contributor} (2): Contributions in class reflect thorough
  preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good
  insights, and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well
  substantiated and often persuasive. If this person were not a member
  of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished.
\item
  \emph{Adequate Contributor} (1): Contributions in class reflect
  satisfactory preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive,
  provide generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for
  the discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well
  substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. If this person were not a
  member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished
  somewhat.
\item
  \emph{Non-Participant} (0): This person says little or nothing in
  class. Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. If this
  person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would
  not be changed.
\item
  \emph{Unsatisfactory Contributor} (-2): Contributions in class reflect
  inadequate preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide
  few if any insights, and never a constructive direction for the class.
  Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. If this
  person were not a member of the class, valuable air-time would be
  saved.
\end{itemize}

If at the end of the course, the majority of your participation was
scored with a 3, you mark will reflect a grade in the A-range. I.e., six
3s or more.

If the majority of your participation was scored as either 3 and 2, you
mark will reflect a grade in the B-range. I.e., six of your
participation scores are 3s or 2s --- more 3s move you more towards a
B+, more 2s move you toward a B-.

Most other combinations of scoring (1s 2s and 3s) will result in a
C-grade. That said, if you only get 1s and 2s you may get a failing
grade.

Note, that each instance of a -2 score for participation effectively
nullifies you highest previous score; it represents a material penalty.

\hypertarget{grading-criteria}{%

Generally, you should be aware that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Written work is graded for quality of writing, grammar, etc., as well
  as content. This includes your learning journals, summative learning
  journals, and the comments and feedback you give to others.
\item
  APA referencing must be used.
\item
  In order to be eligible for 100 percent of your course grade, you must
  participate fully and unequivocally in all of the tasks associated
  with this course.
\end{itemize}

Through the assessments you need to demonstrate the depth and the
quality of your learning about doing qualitative research methods.

This course meets twice a week, on Wednesdays at 16:00, and on Fridays

weeks of the semester. Thus, the average student should expect to spend
25 hours per week on course related activities. My office is in room

\hypertarget{not-so-mechanistic-my-assumptions-about-you}{%
\subsection{Not so mechanistic: My assumptions about
you}\label{not-so-mechanistic-my-assumptions-about-you}}

Having completed BUSINESS 710,\footnote{You should have completed some
  form of research design course before undertaking this course.} you
should have a sense of the \emph{academic conversation} in which you
wish to participate. This implies that you can locate that discussion in
terms of: the discipline/sub-field to which it belongs; the ontology and
epistemology upon which the conversation is based; the (types) of
theories that are typically used; the journals that are relevant; and
the appropriate methodological position \autocite[
p.~7]{huff_2009_designingresearchpublication}. Everything else being
equal, your choices regarding research method are a function of your
choice of academic conversation.

Part of the process of qualitative research is, hopefully, increasing
clarity regarding that conversation. It is not unusual to still be
getting clear on your conversation even at the very last stages of doing
research; e.g., responding to feedback from reviewers of papers when
trying to publish your research.

\includegraphics{images/warning.png} You do not need to base your work
in this course on the research proposal you prepared in BUSINESS 710.
But you do need to have a sense of the conversation to which you want to
participate.

My second assumption is that---sooner or later in your academic
career---you will want to make a contribution to that conversation;
i.e., you will need to design and undertake some research (albeit that
the specific design of that research will be shaped by a range of
factors beyond your research question, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:huff51}.

This course is divided into five major topics: \emph{You and qualitative

practising with the tools and techniques of qualitative methods, the

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Knowledge of qualitative research methods in general.
\item
  Skills in using the various techniques and tools of qualitative
  research.
\item
  Knowledge of the position of qualitative research methods in your
  chosen academic conversation.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Work stream 1} activities will largely take place inside the
class; e.g., practising doing interviews, but will also require work
outside of the too, such as developing an interview schedule.

Activities relating to \emph{Work stream 2} mainly be addressed through
tasks regarding specific readings (e.g., from the textbooks).

In contrast, \emph{work stream 3} activities will be based around you
identifying and reading around your specific research conversation, and
bringing those insights into the classroom to share with your
colleagues.

You will do most of the tasks around work streams 2 and 3 outside of the
classroom.

\hypertarget{week-by-week}{%
\section{Week-by-week in detail}\label{week-by-week}}

My starting point in organising both the class, and the following
chapters, is to constantly focus on what I want you to be able to do in
class. Given that, what you need---in terms of resources, support, and
practice--becomes evident.

As a consequence of that approach, for each week, you will see a
high-level description (class plan) for each class. You will also see a
list of tasks that you need to do to be appropriately prepared for the
class. Whilst `topics' in the class plan are framed as question, your
preparatory tasks are not necessarily structured to directly answer
those questions. Instead, they provide the building blocks from which we
can---together---address those questions.

Note: There are citations scattered throughout this course guide. They
are not necessarily prompts for you to do extra reading. Rather, they
point you towards the sources of ideas that are used here (should you be
so interested). Items that you are expected to read will have that
expectation explicitly stated.

\hypertarget{the-hidden-agenda}{%
\section{The hidden agenda}\label{the-hidden-agenda}}

If this course has a hidden agenda it is to foster the development of
your `qualitative mindset'; a robust link between ones espoused
epistemology and ontology and how one approaches understanding the
social world.

\hypertarget{w1-details}{%
\chapter{Week one}\label{w1-details}}

Having successfully completed the research design course (BUSINESS 710),
you already know a lot about doing research, and so, as we set the scene
this week \emph{re} qualitative research methods, many of issues and
ideas raised this week will be familiar to you.

But we will be going beyond `just' reading and start practising some to
the tools and techniques of qualitative research.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Overview}

In this first session, we hit the ground running and find out about you
(as a academic) and your research interests (in terms of the academic
conversation in which you wish to participate).

Thinking about that participation, an important change that you may have
begun to notice is that staff increasingly treat you as junior
(academic) colleagues, rather than simply as students
\autocite{breuer_2007_issueslearningteaching}; well, I certainly do.
This has many implications from expectations around your self-regulation
\autocite{schunk_2005_selfregulatedlearningeducational} through to how
you present yourself as a researcher.

Qualitative research does not take place in a vacuum. It is shaped by
many factors \autocite[e.g.,][
p.86]{huff_2009_designingresearchpublication}. Consequently, it makes
sense for you to have an understanding of how those factors can affect
your decisions vis-à-vis any qualitative research you might undertake.
So, the starting point of this course is to surface your understanding
of the academic conversation in which you wish to participate (see the
discussion on assumptions in Chapter \ref{course-structure}).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Prep and tasks}

Throughout this chapter---and also for subsequent chapters and
weeks---you should think of the tasks you need to complete as
`deliverables'; you should bring the product of you work to class in a
form that you can use and share with others; i.e., for each deliverable,
a single A4 page will usually suffice (it may comprise notes, diagrams,
\emph{concept maps}, mind maps, etc; whatever works for you and is
intelligible to your colleagues).

I have highlighted concept maps as they are a powerful way to deepen
your understanding of the topics at hand. As with \emph{learning
journals}, \emph{concept maps} foster reflexivity
\autocite{hibbert_2010_reflexivityrecursionrelationality}, an important
characteristic of those who aspire to be qualitative researchers.

This chapter explores concept mapping, with a view of providing enough
background so that you can successful `do' concept mapping.

In this class we move from talking about qualitative research into
actually practising with some of the tools and techniques; and in
particular doing some interviewing (and hopefully, a lot of doing).

Looking at the big-picture, you need to work out how interviewing fits
(or does not fit) with your epistemic/ontological position. And, if it
does fit, in what way does it fit. At a gross level, how you go about
doing an interview---say, the types of questions--will change depending
on how critical/interpretivist/positivist is your stance.

\chapter{Week two}\label{w2-details}}

This week we start to look at our first qualitative research method:
action research.

For Myers a qualitative research method is ``a strategy of enquiry
\ldots{} of finding empirical data about the (social) world''
\autocite*[ p.~4]{myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness}. In a
practical sense, a qualitative research method might drawn a variety of
approaches to collecting and analysing qualitative data; for example, a
case study might use interviews and observations, or may just be
archival research, with the data being analysed through thematic
analysis.

That does not mean the researcher necessarily has a free reign to mix
and match from all of the data collection and analysis techniques.
Depending on the stricutures of any particular research method, only
some combinations might be appropriate
\autocite{gehman_2017_findingtheorymethod}.

Focus groups and participant observation are two approaches to data
collection that are often employed in action research. So, your in-class
`doings' will centre on these techniques.

As you are exposed to new research methods, you should think about the
degree to which they fit with your personal agenda as a researcher.
Although many approaches to conducting research are intended to not
materially impact the organisations and individuals who participate in
the research, some forms of research---such as action research---are
intended to change the status quo. You may or may not want to take on
such a responsibility, as organisational interventions may not always
make things better (and if they do, better for whom).

Last week we explored several forms of interviewing, such as the
semi-structured interview. In this class we will consider the focus
group (sometimes called a group interview). A popular approach to
collecting data in marketing, focus groups are less used in management
and other disciplines, nevertheless, they an import tool in most
researchers repertoires.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Overview}

I think we all develop favourite ways of collecting data; and
observation (participant or non-participant) is my personal `weapon of
choice' when I want to understand what is going on for people. It is
also the weapon of choice in the particular research conversation in
which I participate: strategy-as-practice.

In the case of strategy as practice, it is possible to trace its
`popularity' from strategy-as-practice (as exemplified by the works of
Jarzabakowsi), back to the process/processual studies of the Warwick
group (where Jarzabkowsi did her PhD), to Pettigrew (who was at Warwick
for many years)a and his classic work on ICI
\autocite{pettigrew_1985_awakinggiant}.

All this provides a rich hinterland of `how to go about' research in
that research conversation. Of course, there are other
influences---e.g.~Gioia and his method
\autocite{gioia_2013_seekingqualitativerigor}---but, it is key figures
in the strategy-as-practice `converstation' who have, to a greater or
lesser extent, determined what other methodological influences are seen
as appropriate.

Over time you should become familiar with the history and trajectory of
your particular research conversation.

This week we look at our second qualitative research method, case study
research. In some disciplines/sub-fields, case study research is perhaps
the most prevalent way of doing research. However, I think it is
important not to be side-tracked by the use of cases in teaching (e.g.,
the Harvard method). Rather, we need to concentrate on case studies as a
strategy for doing research.

This week sees us rounding out they ways in which with collect data, by
considering archival (or secondary data) research. We then transition
into the analysis of qualitative data. For many students (and
academics), they analysis of the data is the most challenging part of
qualitative research.

I am somewhat biased as I mainly read in my own area (strategizing in
professional service firms), and within that milieu the case study reins
supreme. So, I perhaps over estimate its importance; but it is a very
important methodology. So this week, you will undertake the first steps
toward doing a research case study; writing a case-description.

Think back to the journal articles where you have seen case
descriptions. If you are not sure what a case description is, no
worries, you have a task to do this week that will address that.

Qualitative data analysis (QDA): anecdotally, one of the big differences
between quantitative research and qualitative research is that, in
quantitative research one spends a lot of time at the `front-end'
working out what is to be done, and the analysis is relative quick.
Whereas, with qualitative research, there is less work at the front-end,
but the analysis takes much longer. When talking with masters and PhD
students about their research plans, we often end up doubling or
tripling the amount of time they set aside to do analysis.

In many ways, thematic analysis, is the swiss-army knife of QDA, and so
we start our journey with a look at this flexible tool that can be used
in a variety of paradigms. The `go-to' references for thematic analysis
are by Miles and Huberman
\autocites{miles_1994_qualitativedataanalysis}{huberman_2002_qualitativeresearchercompanion}.
Many qualitative research methods courses have Miles and Huberman's work
as required reading.

The data collection tools we have explored thus far---interviewing,
focus groups, participant and non-participant observation, and document
collection---can (and are) fruitfully employed the research methods of
action research and case studies. You will find that these tools also
have their uses in ethnographic research (this week) and ground theory
(next week).

Following on from your excursion into thematic analysis, this week you
will be taking a deeper dive into hermeneutics and semiotics.

However, so far, the course has centred on taking research methods (and
various tools of conducting qualitative research) and looking at
individual parts; e.g., case studies have been considered somewhat
separately to interviewing. Thus far, this has led to a rather general
understanding of the topics of the first half of the course. For
example, how interviewing fits with something like ethnographic
research---in particular---has not been considered.

For the remainder of the course, the goal is to start to integrate the
components that, until now, we have been treating a separate and
distinct.

The final research methods we are looking at is grounded theory. When I
last looked on Google Scholar, the seminal work by Glaser and Straus
\autocite*{glaser_1967_discoverygroundedtheory} had nearly 10,000
citation. So, this is a very important strategy in qualitative research.
That said, the ideas from grounded theory around the analysis of
qualitative data are perhaps even more important.

As we head into the `home stretch' of the course, and the topic of
`Presenting your research' it is tempting to think that we have come to
the end of the research process; the data has been collected, analysed,
and all that is left is to present our findings. Alas, it is often the
case that in writing-up our work, we find that we need new literature,
extra data, more analysis. Writing up can often be the trigger for
further iterations through the research cycle. It is not unusual, having
submitted a piece of work that we thought was `perfectly fine', to have
reviewers ask for ``an additional comparative case'', or for the
inclusion of a particular piece of literature that then means additional
interviews have to be done. It is also the case that there are few
researchers who haven't been told ``There are two papers here'', or
``Your research question needs some work'', resulting in almost new
papers being written.

So, writing-up is not always the end.

Even so, as your summative learning journal looms large on the horizon,
the plan for this week is relatively light to allow you to focus on that
task.

\section{Preamble}\label{preamble}}

The University of Auckland has developed a collection of Graduate
Profiles for students in postgraduate level programmes that expresses an
aspiration for its graduates through a set of university-wide attributes
and values which it considers to be attainable by graduates of a leading
research university. They communicate to current and potential students
and faculty, employers, the community, and other academic institutions
the qualities that The University of Auckland seeks to impart to, or
foster in, its graduates. The Graduate Profiles that have been developed
are for: (i) Postgraduate Coursework Graduates; (ii) Postgraduate
Research Graduates (masters level or equivalent); and (iii) Doctoral
Graduates.

The University of Auckland is committed to provide an educational
experience of the highest standards to its students. In addition, The
University of Auckland recognises the needs of a diverse and
multi-cultural student population, including its special responsibility
under Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi.

The implementation of the Graduate Profiles rests with the faculties,
departments, and other teaching and learning support divisions of the
University, which may develop more specific profiles that are suitable
for their subject fields and/or student population. As the student
learning environment changes, the Graduate Profiles will be reviewed.

\hypertarget{description}{%
\section{Description}\label{description}}

The following six themes represent the capabilities that the Business
School seeks to foster in all of its graduates. The development of these
capabilities does not come all at once, but rather is expected to build
from year to year. Each course is not expected to contribute to all
capabilities, but each course will have its own goals and learning
outcomes that relate to the overall development of this profile.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Disciplinary knowledge and practice:} Graduates will be able to
  apply highly specialised knowledge within the discipline to
  demonstrate an advanced awareness and understanding in a global
  context.
\item
  \emph{Critical thinking:} Graduates will be able to analyse and
  evaluate the relevant literature, and design and develop scholarly
  arguments that demonstrate advanced and diverse thinking.
\item
  \emph{Solution seeking:} Graduates will be able to creatively research
  and analyse complex issues, and develop innovative solutions.
\item
  \emph{Communication and engagement:} Graduates will be able to engage,
  communicate, and collaborate with diverse groups using multiple
  formats and effectively address a range of professional and academic
  audiences.
\item
  \emph{Independence and integrity:} Graduates will be able to
  demonstrate advanced independent thought, self- reflection, ethics,
  and integrity.
\item
  \emph{Social and environmental responsibility:} Graduates will
  consider, in relation to their discipline, the potential significance
  of the principles underpinning both the Treaty of Waitangi and
  sustainability.

\hypertarget{my-teaching-and-your-learning}{%
\section{My teaching and your
learning}\label{my-teaching-and-your-learning}}

My approach to teaching is shaped by three concerns. First, ``What is it
that I want you to be able to do at the end of the course?'' What
skills, knowledge, and attitudes am I seeking to engender---what do I
hope you will have learn? This is articulated through the learning
outcomes for the course.

When I talk of learning, I following Terry Doyle, in that:

\begin{quote}
Learning is the ability to use information after a significant period of
disuse

and

It is the ability to use the information to solve problems in a context
different (if only slightly) from the context in which the information
was originally learnt.
\end{quote}

In a nutshell, I want you to be able apply what you have learnt here to
your own (future) research project(s).

My second concern is ``What is the best use of our time together?''.
Implicitly, this also addresses the use of your individual study time).
The result of this concern is a preference for a `flipped' classroom,
where delivery of the content of the course takes place outside of the
classroom, and where time in the classroom is spent working with that
content to refining your understanding.

Finally, ``What are effective ways of learning?'' As noted earlier,
praticing something is one way to become more accomplished at it. That
process can be accelerated by engaging in explicit reflection of ones
practice(s), on your `doings' and `sayings'
\autocite{schatzki_2001_practiceturncontemporary}.

\hypertarget{history}{%
\chapter{History of the course}\label{history}}

\hypertarget{the-current-course}{%
\section{The current course}\label{the-current-course}}

Why do yet another qualitative methods course? Many---and maybe even
most---universities offer qualitative research methods course. There are
also a plethora of textbooks on the subject. Then, there are a wide
array of on-line resources; videos, web pages, and so on.

So, there has to be a question about why re-invent the wheel.

Part of the answer is about fitting the needs of our students as they
head into their dissertations and theses. Part of the answer is, that I
have tried to avoid reinventing anything. To that end, this course is
the result of the input of many people including Brigid Carroll, Michael
Myers, Cathy Urquhart, Margarita Mooney, and Ann Langley; drawing on
existing expertise and resources.

And so. I have tried to take their advice and ideas and synthesis
something that is a good fit for students in Management \& International
Business, here at the University of Auckland.

\hypertarget{the-history-of-the-course}{%
\section{The history of the course}\label{the-history-of-the-course}}

Research has been taught in this department, at a postgraduate level,
for at least 20 years that I know of. In 1997, there were two courses,
Research Methods I and II, that sought to ``ensure that all \ldots{}
master's students have the basic research skills and concepts to enable
them to do a master's thesis''.

By 2000, the courses had morphed into on the \emph{Foundations of
Research}, addressing the ``theory and philosophy of social science
research methods'' and \emph{Research Practice}, focusing on ``applying
research methods in organisational contexts''.

With the change from being MGMT courses to BUSINESS courses, the focus
of became something that would be familiar to current students, a
courses on \emph{Research design}, \emph{Qualitative research}, and
\emph{Quantitative research}.

In 2017 the \emph{Advanced qualitative research} and \emph{Advanced
qualitative research} courses were introduced to address the different
needs that PhD candidates have, in comparison to the needs of masters
students doing a dissertation or a 120-point thesis.

\hypertarget{pis}{%
\chapter{Participant information sheet}\label{pis}}

Participant information sheet for individuals Title: BUSINESS 705

Dear Participant,

My name is Peter Smith, and I am the course director for the course
BUSINESS 705 (Qualitative Research Methods), and I would like to invite
you to participate the research activities of the course.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The purpose of this Participant Information Sheet, and the important
information it contains is to provide you with enough detail so you can
make an informed decision about taking part in the research activities
in BUSINESS 705. The goal here is one of informed consent; that is good
ethics practice.

If you review the course's learning objectives, you will see that
participating in the research activities of the course will lead to you
becoming a better qualitative researcher, and to better understand the
implications of doing qualitative research. That is the goal of the
research activities in class.

If having read everything here, you decide this is not the course for
you, as with any course, you can withdraw from the course without
penalty for the first two weeks. In that case, you should contact either
the MCom advisor or the BComHons advisor to find an alternative methods
course.

Note, that if you are planning to do BUSINESS 712 (Advanced Qualitative
Methods), the timing of that course may mean you will not be able to do
it this semester (remember, BUSINESS 705 is in the first half of this
semester, and BUSINESS 712 is in the second half of the semester).

\hypertarget{research-in-business-705}{%
\section{Research in BUSINESS 705}\label{research-in-business-705}}

There is an old saw says that practice makes perfect. As this course is
about qualitative research methods---and in particular, about preparing
you to undertake your own research in the future---an important part of
this course is actually doing the stuff of qualitative research. To
build your skills in this area, you will practice common qualitative
research techniques. For example, you will design an interview guide and
then conduct interviews using that guide.

More formally, you will act as an investigator and actually use the
tools of qualitative research to collect data from your classmates; this
implies that you will also act as a participant when it is the turn of
your classmates to act as investigators. As a participant, you need to
be fully informed about the consequences of your participation in the
research activities that will take place within the BUSINESS 705
classroom. In what follows, the research activities that will take place
in BUSINESS 705 are explained.

To be explicit, you---and your classmates---will be the ones carrying
out the research procedures (e.g., conducting the interviews). Peter,
your lecturer, is there to help and assist, but not to `do'; he is not
collecting any research data.

\hypertarget{the-nature-of-your-participation}{%
\section{The nature of your
participation}\label{the-nature-of-your-participation}}

As described in the section on Assessments (in the course guide), a
significant method of assessing your learning is through a reflective
learning journal, centered the nature of your learning about qualitative
research methods. Such work has auto-ethnographical components, and so
is a form of participant observation that combines the roles of
investigator and participant. Thus, being both an investigator and as a
participant are integral parts of this course. Your enrollment in this
course is taken as implicit consent to this.

As part of your work in the class you will be party to, and participate
in:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Participant and non-participant observations
\item
  Interviews
\item
  Focus groups
\end{itemize}

Given that you will be doing participant observation, everything that
you, and your peers, do and say in the class---either formally or
informally---may become data.

At times your participation may be recorded (either by video or by
digital audio). This is so you can compare and contrast the impact of
recording (versus note taking) both from the perspective of the
participant and that of the investigator. Such recordings will not be
kept; at the end of the class they will be deleted. Even so, you should
assume that everything you do and say in the class may be recorded; as
novice researchers, it is possible that someone (when acting as an
investigator) neglects to notify participants that they are being
recorded.

At any time---without giving any reason---you may:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Withdraw from participation
\item
  Elect not to be recorded
\end{itemize}

If you opt-out you will be given alternative work to do (typically
involving readings and videos from the SAGE Research Methods website).
It is not possible to replicate the learning that comes from `doing' and
so if you do opt-out you will have a qualitatively different experience
and probably a different type of learning.

\hypertarget{purpose-of-the-research}{%
\section{Purpose of the research}\label{purpose-of-the-research}}

The primary purpose of the research activities in BUSINESS 705 is to
give you and your peers the opportunity to practice techniques of
qualitative research. There is no intent on Peter's part that the data
collected will lead to a published output, say, a journal article.

The overarching topic that frames activities in which you will
participate in is ``My learning of qualitative research methods''.

\hypertarget{location-of-the-research}{%
\section{Location of the research}\label{location-of-the-research}}

You will only be acting as a participant during the scheduled class time
of BUSINESS 705.

\hypertarget{confidentiality}{%
\section{Confidentiality}\label{confidentiality}}

Given the nature of the class, it is not possible to promise
confidentiality around either your participation in general or your data
in particular. Your classmates will know that you are `in the class',
they will see, for example, the interviews in which you participate, and
thus everyone in the class will---to some degree or other---have access
to the data that is elicited from one other.

Furthermore, other people not in the class will know that you have
(mostly like) participated in the research activities in the class;
e.g., administrative staff with access to details of the course on
Canvas.

\hypertarget{potential-risks}{%
\section{Potential risks}\label{potential-risks}}

Give the topic of the research activities, and the nature of those
research activities, it is anticipated that there are no potential risks
of significance that are materially different from any other class where
you might be required to keep a learning journal or other reflective
pieces of work.

\hypertarget{data-retention}{%
\section{Data retention}\label{data-retention}}

You should be aware that the data collected by your peers may be
retained by them (as part of their learning journals) indefinitely.

As noted earlier, electronic recordings are to be deleted at the end of
the classes in which they are made.

\chapter{The historical roots of engineering}\label{engineering}}

The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the historical
context from which a variety of engineering disciplines have emerged.
The compilation of any history of engineering requires the researcher to
make choices as to what is, and what is not, included. This applies as
much to the selection of which disciplines of engineering to review, as
to the events and pressures that shaped the profession. Consequently,
this history does not address the role of engineers in, for instance,
nuclear engineering or microelectronics. Instead, the disciplines with
greater relevance to Arlington are emphasised. Such editing is a
necessity of space and time.

The etymology of engineer is found in the notion of one who does
something ingenious (Oxford University Press, 1989); that is, ``a person
possessing an innovative mind and skilful hands'', an ``ingeniator''
(Harms, 2004, p.~3). Though some engineers, trace their heritage as
ingeniators to prehistoric tool making (Harms, 2004), it is during the
Renaissance (circa 1300--1699), that the beginning of modern engineering
becomes more apparent (Garrison, 1998). During that time, engineers
adopted mathematical methods to tackle a variety of problems such as
statics (the mechanics of rigid bodies), ballistics, and topographical
surveying. They drew on systematic empirical investigation and adopted
scientific language (Armytage, 1976; Garrison, 1998; Norrie, 1956). The
use of mathematical methods, together with the adoption of scientific
method marks, the transition of engineering from an occupation based on
artisanship towards one more resembling the modern profession. During
the seventeenth and eighteen centuries, engineers progressively
formalised their training. Until about 1760, most engineering was
associated with governmental works including ``the constructional
requirements of \ldots{} dockyards and harbours, of land fortifications
and of roads built for the better travel of troops rather than for civil
needs'' (Norrie, 1956, p.~6). The need for such military engineering led
to the establishment of the French corps of engineers. The formation of
the Corps de Ponts et Chaussées (of bridges and roads) in 1716 was
followed by the founding of an engineering school, L'École des Ponts et
Chaussées in 1747 (Armytage, 1976). The creation of this school was
followed a by number of others and it became the model for L'École
Polytechnique both in and beyond France (Garrison, 1998). The academic
leadership of French engineering led to the publication of the first
civil engineering reference books. Two of the most notable are Science
des Ingénieurs in 1729 and Architecture Hydraulique in 1737. The first
of these were in print for over one-hundred years (Norrie, 1956).

Engineers were also involved in the formation of professional societies.
In England, a meeting in 1660 to discuss ``the founding of a colledge
for the promoting of Physico-Mathematicall Experimentall Learning''
culminated in the creation of the Royal Society in 1662 (Armytage, 1976,
p.~77). During the eighteenth century, the meaning of engineer grew to
encompass those undertaking civil works. The applications of civil
engineering included the construction of canals, bridges, and wharves
(Garrison, 1998). John Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse,
founded the Society for Civil Engineers in 1771. The Smeatonian Society,
as it was sometimes called, the first of its kind, was an expression of
the professional interests of its members in civil engineering (Norrie,
1956). It led to the establishment of the Institution of Civil Engineers
in 1818 and, in turn, to the first English school of engineering in 1827
at King's College in London (Norrie, 1956). In America, civil engineers
created their professional society, the American Society of Civil
Engineers and Architects, in 1852.

Aside from civil engineering, other engineering specialisations arose.
Mechanical engineers were at the forefront of the industrial revolution
(Garrison, 1998). They brought their knowledge and skill to improving
waterpower and to the development of steam power. Alongside these
advances, engineers created new processes for manufacturing iron and
steel. Mining engineers, in expediting the supply of coal and iron ore,
facilitated this. Mass-production of iron and steel, together with steam
power, enabled the creation of much of the of transportation
infrastructure in the form of steamships and railways (Garrison, 1998).
With the expansion of the railways came greater demand for bridges,
often constructed from the new mass-produced iron and steel. The rise of
the steamship also produced the new engineering discipline of naval
engineering (Armytage, 1976). These new engineers drew on the practices
of other engineering disciplines. For example, similar to bridge
designers, they utilised physical models to predict more accurately the
performance of their designs using a combination of mathematics,
experimentation, and intuition.

In Germany, a new breed of engineers, chemical engineers, were advancing
industrial chemistry (Armytage, 1976; Harms, 2004). The variety of
products produced by chemical engineering include dyes, drugs,
explosives, acids, organic chemicals and other ``fine chemicals''
(Garrison, 1998). Nevertheless, engineers were not concerned solely with
commerce; epidemiological studies in the mid-1800s highlighted the
necessity of potable water supplies and separate sewage disposal
resulting in the emergence of sanitary and hydraulic engineers. The
first electrical engineers also appeared during this period. The work of
Michael Faraday, André-Marie Ampere, and others, led to the emergence,
and widespread distribution, of the electrical industry (Garrison,
1998). Innovations such as electric lighting, the telegraph, and the
accompanying electrification of cities changed the way people worked and
lived. Power for the new electrical networks came from steam turbines or
from waterpower. For example, in 1893, Westinghouse won the contract to
build generators powered by the water from Niagara Falls. Such
large-scale projects necessitated the effort of many engineers across
many specialisations, working together with those contracted for
construction.

During the nineteenth century, there were significant changes in the way
that construction was undertaken. Until that time, casual labour was
utilised to undertake public works. However, those who funded such works
increasingly sought ``binding commitments to cover all the risks and
responsibilities of construction'' (Norrie, 1956, p.~89) and guarantees
against contractors failing to complete the contracted work. As a
result, contractors changed from being simple suppliers of organised
labour to ``men of greater calibre to carry the executive burden''
(Norrie, 1956, p.~89). As British engineers and navvies were employed
overseas, the new contracting methods spread to France and beyond.
Contracting for construction work developed into a project-based
business. Even in the early days the ``contractor's assets could
generally be easily realized and a business be wound up without undue
loss, and many with good profits took advantage of this'' (Norrie, 1956,
p.~97). One result of the move to contracting was that for any project
there were often three parties involved: the client, who would fund the
project; the engineer who would do the design work; and the contractor,
who would actually build the project, often under the partial
supervision of the engineer. Such tripartite arrangements predominate
even to this day. The traditional approach is for the client to select a
designer (an engineering firm or an architectural firm) and a contractor
(who will actual build what is designed) through a process of
competitive bidding (Beard, Loulakis, \& Wundram, 2001). If multiple
forms of design work are required, such as structural engineering and
fire engineering, then a lead design firm may tender for the work in
conjunction with other, subcontracted, firms. Similarly, if the
construction of the project requires multiple contractors, a lead
contractor will engage sub-contractors and sub-trades as necessary. This
process is known as the design-bid-build project delivery method. The
twentieth century saw the rise of new forms of engineering, including
petroleum engineering, aeronautical or aerospace engineering, electronic
engineering, biomedical engineering, and other specialties.
Classification of engineers, such as mechanical or civil engineers, is
illustrative of how engineering is associated with the classes of
devices they produce (Harms, 2004). For the purpose of this thesis, the
major categorisations of contemporary engineering are civil, mechanical,
electrical, structural, water, material, surveying, transportation,
urban, and industrial.
