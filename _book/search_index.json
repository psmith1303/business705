Over the coming six weeks, I hope that you will find this an engaging and fun course. My overarching goal for this course is to prepare you to undertake your first (and perhaps only) research project of any size; e.g., a masters (60-point) dissertation or an honours (30-point) dissertation. This is my touchstone in all my thinking regarding BUSINESS 705. To that end, I want you to be able to select qualitative research methods that are appropriate for your chosen academic conversation (Huff, 2009), and to use those methods in a proficient manner. This course guide includes details of the assessments, leading to an overview of the course. If you have not already done so, you should familiarize yourself with the formal course outline. In order to learn about qualitative research methods, you will actually use a range of research methods and techniques. In doing so, you will act both as an investigator in research and as a research participant. Undertaking those dual roles is a fundamental part of the course’s design. Your enrolment in this course is taken as your implicit agreement to the being a research participant as explained in the participant information sheet. Getting started Read how the course fits together (assessments, course overview, and the course outline) Print out the To Do checklist for the course. This will remind you of the tasks and milestones you need to meet Once you have done those four steps, you will be well positioned to be successful in this course. If you have questions, please checkout the Frequently Asked Questions chapter. Beyond the basics For those who are interested, there is information on the ‘back story’ of the course. This includes: How the course relates to the MCom Postgraduate profile The design decisions that guided much of what goes on The history of the course Some tips and tricks for using this e-book The toolbar If you are using the website version of this e-book, you should see a toolbar at the top of the screen.

In other words, by the end of this course it is expected that you will be able to: select qualitative research methods that are appropriate to the research conversation in which the student wishes to participate; be proficient in use tools and techniques in qualitative research; effectively communicate the findings arising from qualitative research; justify the choices made around the collection, analysis, and presentation of qualitative data, congruent with your chosen research conversation. 1.3 Weekly learning journals Task objectives To foster self-reflection on (a) the theory presented in the course, and (b) your experiences in being both an investigator and a participant in qualitative research. To help with your sense making (Sensemaking in organizations, 1995) regarding this course. A casual search using Google Scholar for learning journals provides a plethora of articles extolling their virtues. Broadly, learning journals foster high quality self-reflection and increase critical thinking. You are to maintain a learning journal. Later, you are to use the your journal entries as the ‘data’ for a summative learning journal/essay on your major learnings from this course. Task overview During the course you are to write 10 learning journals of at least 400 words. The more you write the more grist you will have for your summative learning journal. In each of your learning journal entries, you are to explore the linkages between the theoretical content of the course; e.g., the readings and class sessions with your practical experience e.g., doing and using qualitative research tools and techniques. As well as content (theory) from this course, you may, if appropriate, draw on material from other courses; indeed, you should make linkages to BUSINESS 710. Ultimately, you should be considering the real difference the course is making to your thinking and behaviour around qualitative research. What does a good learning journal look like? Let’s begin by looking at the common problems. Based on experience with previous classes, the main problems are: Many journals do not have a logical structure; the approach recommended by Daudelin (1996), should be your model. Using Daudelin’s method is the one most significant changes that most people could make when trying to improve their learning journals. When using theory in their journals, people often use it to label things; e.g., ‘Interviews with more than two people are often called focus groups’. Very few (if any) people are using theory to either explain what is happening, or predict what might happen. This is closely tied to the focus of some journals (i.e, not substantively addressing a real issue). My assumption is that this is partly because people aren’t drawing on particular theory to address a particular problem; instead they are drawing on the ‘theory of the week’. I really encourage you to use Daudeline’s approach, select theory that supports that issue (and that won’t necessarily be theory of the week). Finally, many journals read like a ‘stream of conscious’, rather than a considered (and edited) reflection upon the week’s learning and writing up that reflection. 1.4 Peer review of learning journals Task objectives Reflexivity—as distinct from reflection (Hibbert, Coupland, &amp; MacIntosh, 2010)—is an important characteristic of qualitative research and its researchers (Haynes, 2012). Through evaluating and commenting on the reflections of your peers, this assignment seeks to engender greater reflexivity. To provide developmental feedback on your peers’ thinking about their stance and approach to qualitative research. Task overview Each week you must review, provide feedback on, and evaluate the learning journals of two of your colleagues. Over the course you will write 20 sets of feedback. Your primary goal in providing feedback is to help the author do a better job next time. If you feedback does not achieve that, then the author can rightly complain about the quality of your feedback (and that will affect your marks). The feedback should, as a minimum, address: How well the journal meets the guidelines provided by Daudelin (1996). The extent to which the journal demonstrates achievement in the higher levels of Bloom et al.’s (1956) taxonomy of the cognitive domain. The quality of the writing. In all cases, you should suggest how they might improve their journal; it is insufficient to point out the weaknesses in their journal without providing specific actionable ways they might improve. For example, it is not good enough to say, “Check your grammar”. Rather you explain the nature of the problem and how they might fix it. Having said that, items like grammar and spelling are ‘hygiene’ factors—you should first provide feedback on more material aspects of journals, and then move on to the smaller matters (if warranted). That being said, the secondary goal—and a characteristic of the best reviews–is to foster the development of greater reflexivity in your peers’ and your own approach to qualitative research. 1.5 Summative learning journal Task objectives Build on the weekly learning journals to enable an integrative reflection of your learning across the whole course. To demonstrate what you regard as being most important in being a qualitative researcher. To provide a basis for the evaluation of your achievement of the course’s learning objectives. Task overview This final part of the assignment is a summative evaluation of your weekly journals. Drawing on your weekly journal entries, you are to write a final, summative journal entry of at least 2,000 words. Your summative learning journal is quite different to your weekly learning journals. It should focus on something that you have learnt throughout the course and demonstrate what you can do better now than what you could do before the course. It must demonstrate the breadth as well as the depth, of what you have learnt. It should provide good evidence of both evaluation and synthesis (Bloom, 1956). It should be based on the ‘data’ from your weekly learning journals, and possible insights you have had as a result of providing feedback on others’ learning journals; you may also draw on other writing you have done for this course.. It will probably focus on one or two major takeaways/insights. Maybe three, certainly not five. These are the things that have changed the way you think about qualitative research methods and changed your (planned) behaviour. The summative journal should not focus on being too personal about your experiences throughout the course, but instead focus on how you can apply your learning in the future. You should strive to demonstrate how you meet the learning objectives of this course, in the context of the postgraduate profile. General comments on the weekly and summative learning journals For many in the class, this is the first time they will have had to undertake reflective writing. As a result, some people will approach this assignment with some trepidation. For those people, the article by Daudelin (1996) will provide assistance. As you progress, you should find writing journals increasingly easy and natural. As a result, your later journals may be considerably longer than your earlier ones. Because of this, there is no upper word limit for your weekly journal entries. In your learning journals, it is normal and acceptable to use the first person (e.g., I, me, etc.). The quality of your writing matters. Failing to correctly cite/reference material in your journals can incur a 10-percent penalty being applied to your summative learning journal. You should correctly cite your weekly learning journal using an APA formatted references. If it looks like you have ‘blown off’ doing the weekly learning journals it is impossible to get a passing grade for the summative learning journals. In this context, meaningful feedback means that the recipient can unambiguously use it to improve their work within the guidelines provided (in the opinion of the recipient, other classmates, or the teaching staff). If you feel unhappy about the quality of the feedback you receive from your peers, let the teaching staff know. 1.6 Participation Task objectives To provide an opportunity to practice with the tools and techniques of qualitative research. To gain experience of the consequences of the choice and use of differing tools and techniques of qualitative research. To better prepare you to do qualitative research. Task overview I want you to participate so that you can learn from each other. Good participation is known to increases what is remembered, how well it is assimilated, and how the learning is used in new situations. Through participating, you will clarify your own thinking about the content of the course, and you will provide your peers with the opportunity to provide constructive feedback, further deepening your understanding of the material. Likewise, in listening to, and responding to, the participation of others, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate alternate ways of interpreting and applying class material. In a course like this, that stresses the application of material, extensive participation an essential element of students’ learning and of the classes success. Grading participation I am a holistic marker, and each class, I will evaluate your participation using the following guidelines: Outstanding Contributor (3): Contributions in class reflect exceptional preparation. Ideas offered are always substantive, and provide one or more major insights as well as direction for the class. Challenges are well substantiated and persuasively presented. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished markedly. Good Contributor (2): Contributions in class reflect thorough preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good insights, and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well substantiated and often persuasive. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished. Adequate Contributor (1): Contributions in class reflect satisfactory preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive, provide generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished somewhat. Non-Participant (0): This person says little or nothing in class. Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would not be changed. Unsatisfactory Contributor (-2): Contributions in class reflect inadequate preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any insights, and never a constructive direction for the class. Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. If this person were not a member of the class, valuable air-time would be saved. If at the end of the course, the majority of your participation was scored with a 3, you mark will reflect a grade in the A-range. I.e., six 3s or more. If the majority of your participation was scored as either 3 and 2, you mark will reflect a grade in the B-range. I.e., six of your participation scores are 3s or 2s — more 3s move you more towards a B+, more 2s move you toward a B-. Most other combinations of scoring (1s 2s and 3s) will result in a C-grade. That said, if you only get 1s and 2s you may get a failing grade. Note, that each instance of a -2 score for participation effectively nullifies you highest previous score; it represents a material penalty. 1.7 Grading criteria The table below shows the general criteria against which work is assessed. Although ‘grading on the curve’ is not used, it is usual that most students work falls within the B-range. Grade Description A+ Rare, outstanding A Exceptional and beyond what was expected A- Excellent B+ Polished and very good B Covers everything that was expected, comprehensive; demonstrated good understanding B- Good coverage but minor flaws C+ Demonstrated adequate understanding of fundamentals, but some gaps C Just adequate, some problems C- Just adequate, many problems D+ Inadequate and lack of understanding D Very poor Generally, you should be aware that: Written work is graded for quality of writing, grammar, etc., as well as content. This includes your learning journals, summative learning journals, and the comments and feedback you give to others. APA referencing must be used. In order to be eligible for 100 percent of your course grade, you must participate fully and unequivocally in all of the tasks associated with this course. Through the assessments you need to demonstrate the depth and the quality of your learning about doing qualitative research methods. "],

Thus, the average student should expect to spend 25 hours per week on course related activities. My office is in room 439, of the Owen G. Glenn Building (260-439), and—during term time—I have office hours on Wednesday at 15:00. My email address is mail@petersmith.org. 2.1.2 Not so mechanistic: My assumptions about you Having completed BUSINESS 710,1 you should have a sense of the academic conversation in which you wish to participate. This implies that you can locate that discussion in terms of: the discipline/sub-field to which it belongs; the ontology and epistemology upon which the conversation is based; the (types) of theories that are typically used; the journals that are relevant; and the appropriate methodological position (Huff, 2009, p. 7). Everything else being equal, your choices regarding research method are a function of your choice of academic conversation. Part of the process of qualitative research is, hopefully, increasing clarity regarding that conversation. It is not unusual to still be getting clear on your conversation even at the very last stages of doing research; e.g., responding to feedback from reviewers of papers when trying to publish your research. You do not need to base your work in this course on the research proposal you prepared in BUSINESS 710. But you do need to have a sense of the conversation to which you want to participate. My second assumption is that—sooner or later in your academic career—you will want to make a contribution to that conversation; i.e., you will need to design and undertake some research (albeit that the specific design of that research will be shaped by a range of factors beyond your research question, as shown in Figure 2.1. Figure 2.1: Design decisions connecting research purpose and outcomes (Huff, 2009, p. 86). 2.2 The general structure of the course This course is divided into five major topics: You and qualitative research, Qualitative methods, Collecting qualitative data, Analysing qualitative data, and Presenting your results. However, to maximise the amount of time you can spend practising with the tools and techniques of qualitative methods, the course is structured around three concurrent streams of activities: Knowledge of qualitative research methods in general. Skills in using the various techniques and tools of qualitative research. Knowledge of the position of qualitative research methods in your chosen academic conversation. Work stream 1 activities will largely take place inside the class; e.g., practising doing interviews, but will also require work outside of the too, such as developing an interview schedule. Activities relating to Work stream 2 mainly be addressed through tasks regarding specific readings (e.g., from the textbooks). In contrast, work stream 3 activities will be based around you identifying and reading around your specific research conversation, and bringing those insights into the classroom to share with your colleagues. You will do most of the tasks around work streams 2 and 3 outside of the classroom. 2.3 Topic guide Week Knowledge focus Skill focus 1 You and qualitative research methods Collecting qualitative data Interviews 2 Research methods Action research Focus groups Participant observation 3 Case study research Archival research Analysing qualitative data Thematic analysis 4 Ethnographic research Hermeneutics Semiotics 5 Grounded theory Narrative analysis Discourse analysis 6 Presenting your results 2.4 Pattern of work The pattern of your work in this class, is generally: Complete the tasks to prepare for the classwork Do exercises in class Write your weekly learning journal Review the learning journals that you have been allocated 2.5 Workload As already noted, the average student should expect to spend about 20 hours each week doing work related to this course (including class time). To guide your efforts, I have indicated the approximate time you should spend on each of the major tasks described in the week-by-week guide (Chapter 2.6). A typical allocation of time to this course looks like this: Activity Hours Prep for first class 7 Class time (first class) 3 Prep for second class 7 Class time (second class) 3 Writing learning journal 3 Reviewing learning journals 2 Total time 20 If you find that my estimations of the time you need is widely out, please let me know; that way I can either: Help with alternate strategies for tackling the tasks, or Change or remove some of the tasks. 2.6 Week-by-week in detail My starting point in organising both the class, and the following chapters, is to constantly focus on what I want you to be able to do in class. Given that, what you need—in terms of resources, support, and practice–becomes evident. As a consequence of that approach, for each week, you will see a high-level description (class plan) for each class. You will also see a list of tasks that you need to do to be appropriately prepared for the class. Whilst ‘topics’ in the class plan are framed as question, your preparatory tasks are not necessarily structured to directly answer those questions. Instead, they provide the building blocks from which we can—together—address those questions. Note: There are citations scattered throughout this course guide. They are not necessarily prompts for you to do extra reading. Rather, they point you towards the sources of ideas that are used here (should you be so interested). Items that you are expected to read will have that expectation explicitly stated. 2.7 The hidden agenda If this course has a hidden agenda it is to foster the development of your ‘qualitative mindset’; a robust link between ones espoused epistemology and ontology and how one approaches understanding the social world. cd# Week one {#w1-details} Having successfully completed the research design course (BUSINESS 710), you already know a lot about doing research, and so, as we set the scene this week re qualitative research methods, many of issues and ideas raised this week will be familiar to you. But we will be going beyond ‘just’ reading and start practising some to the tools and techniques of qualitative research. First class Overview In this first session, we hit the ground running and find out about you (as a academic) and your research interests (in terms of the academic conversation in which you wish to participate). Thinking about that participation, an important change that you may have begun to notice is that staff increasingly treat you as junior (academic) colleagues, rather than simply as students (Breuer &amp; Schreier, 2007); well, I certainly do. This has many implications from expectations around your self-regulation (Schunk, 2005) through to how you present yourself as a researcher. Qualitative research does not take place in a vacuum. It is shaped by many factors (e.g., Huff, 2009, p. 86). Consequently, it makes sense for you to have an understanding of how those factors can affect your decisions vis-à-vis any qualitative research you might undertake. So, the starting point of this course is to surface your understanding of the academic conversation in which you wish to participate (see the discussion on assumptions in Chapter 2). Class plan Welcome to BUSINESS 705 As academics, what would be useful to know about one another?&quot; What do you want to know about the course? How are qualitative and quantitative research different? What role will qualitative research play in your academic life? What does ethics in qualitative research look like? Prep and tasks Throughout this chapter—and also for subsequent chapters and weeks—you should think of the tasks you need to complete as ‘deliverables’; you should bring the product of you work to class in a form that you can use and share with others; i.e., for each deliverable, a single A4 page will usually suffice (it may comprise notes, diagrams, mind maps, etc; whatever works for you and is intelligible to your colleagues). Review “Choosing an academic home” (Huff, 2009) — 30 minutes; Describe the academic conversation to which you wish to make a contribution — 30 minutes. Given the characteristics of your choose academic conversation, discuss the extent to which there are well understood patterns of research; i.e., is it the case that you are “in the midst of a conversation where many choices have been previously debated and an overarching agenda has been established” (Huff, 2009, p. 87). What are the implications of those patterns for the choice of methods in your conversation? — 60 minutes. Read “Part I” and “Part 2” of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 3–56) — 120 minutes. Summarise the main ‘big ideas’ that underpin Chapter 2 of the textbook. What parallels, if any, are there with other books and articles you have read? — 20 minutes. Compare and contrast the role of philosophic assumptions as presented by Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013) and Huff (2009) — 40 minutes. The University of Auckland has a processes and policies around conducting research. One of the most important documents is entitled “Guiding principles for conducting research with human participants.” A copy of these guidelines can be found on the University’s website at: https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/research/re-ethics/re-uahpec.html. Read the “Guiding Principles for conducting research with human participants” (“Guiding principles for conducting research with human participants,” 2013) — 40 minutes. Discuss the relationships that exist—or their lack—between Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013), Huff (2009) and the University’s “Guiding principles …” with regard to ethics in conducting research — 20 minutes. Second class Overview In this class we move from talking about qualitative research into actually practising with some of the tools and techniques; and in particular doing some interviewing (and hopefully, a lot of doing). Looking at the big-picture, you need to work out how interviewing fits (or does not fit) with your epistemic/ontological position. And, if it does fit, in what way does it fit. At a gross level, how you go about doing an interview—say, the types of questions–will change depending on how critical/interpretivist/positivist is your stance. Class plan What questions and comments do you have arising from the first class? Where do you place yourself and the research conversation that you are interested in? Positivist, interpretivist, critical, something else? In small groups, who has the best interview guidelines for the structured interview? How easy is it to do a structured interview? How easy is it to do a semi-structured interview? How does note-taking versus recording impact the interview process? Looking ahead to your learning journals, are you clear what you need to do (as opposed to being clear as to what you will do — ends and means). Prep and tasks Read chapter 9 of Huff (2009) — 20 minutes. Identify the likely types of goals when using interviews, for positivist, interpretivist, and critical research — 40 minutes. Read the start of “Part IV” of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 117–135) — 60 minutes. Develop a script (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, p. 129) (including an interview guide) for a structured interview on the topic of “The difference between interpretivist, positivist, and critical forms of research” — 30 minutes. Develop a script (including an interview guide) for a semi-structured interview on the topic of “The most useful article (not book) you ever read about research methods” — 30 minutes. Explore the ‘little blue books’ at SAGE research methods site http://methods.sagepub.com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/. Select one book that focuses on interviewing; spend an hour skim reading, and then summarise the book — 90 minutes. Use the SAGE research methods site again, and find “The SAGE Handbook of interview research: The complexity of the craft” and read Chapter 15 (Wang &amp; Yan, 2017) — 60 minutes. Identify that chapter’s main message — 10 minutes. Having done tasks 4–6, do you need to revise your interview scripts (yes/no)? — 10 minutes. End of week With the week’s classes behind you, it is time to do your learning journal (Section 1.3 ‐ 60 minutes) and then do your review the learning journals of your peers (Section 1.3 ‐ 60 minutes). You should have completed some form of research design course before undertaking this course.↩ "],
["w2-details.html", "Chapter 3 Week two First class Second class End of week", " Chapter 3 Week two This week we start to look at our first qualitative research method: action research. For Myers a qualitative research method is “a strategy of enquiry … of finding empirical data about the (social) world” (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, p. 4). In a practical sense, a qualitative research method might drawn a variety of approaches to collecting and analysing qualitative data; for example, a case study might use interviews and observations, or may just be archival research, with the data being analysed through thematic analysis. That does not mean the researcher necessarily has a free reign to mix and match from all of the data collection and analysis techniques. Depending on the stricutures of any particular research method, only some combinations might be appropriate (Gehman et al., 2017). Focus groups and participant observation are two approaches to data collection that are often employed in action research. So, your in-class ‘doings’ will centre on these techniques. First class Overview As you are exposed to new research methods, you should think about the degree to which they fit with your personal agenda as a researcher. Although many approaches to conducting research are intended to not materially impact the organisations and individuals who participate in the research, some forms of research—such as action research—are intended to change the status quo. You may or may not want to take on such a responsibility, as organisational interventions may not always make things better (and if they do, better for whom). Last week we explored several forms of interviewing, such as the semi-structured interview. In this class we will consider the focus group (sometimes called a group interview). A popular approach to collecting data in marketing, focus groups are less used in management and other disciplines, nevertheless, they an import tool in most researchers repertoires. Class plan What were your big takeaways, and questions from last week? Why do you think Peter likes the SAGE Research Methods website so much? How can you find action research projects? How would you ‘do’ an action research project? What makes a good plan for doing a focus group? Prep and tasks Read the start of “Part III” of Myer (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 57–72) — 40 minutes. Discuss the pros and cons of doing action research in a 60-point dissertation — 20 minutes. Describe the difference between engaging in a consulting project and a action research project — 20 minutes. Go to the SAGE Research Methods website (http://methods.sagepub.com), and search for ‘action research’, you will see there are a lot of resources (including specialised texts) available to you. Identify one of the texts that you think would be appropriately helpful to you if you were to do action research as part of a year long thesis (you may need to make and state, some assumptions). Summarise your reasons for you choice, and be prepared to share it with your colleagues — 30 minutes. Beyond that, the SAGE Research Methods website also has a range of video clips. Find the 45 minute video called “David Coghlan Discusses Action Research”, and review it — 50 minutes. Describe the biggest difference between David Coghlan’s ‘take’ on action research compared to Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013) — 10 minutes. Search the leading journal in your field (e.g., if you are in ‘innovation’ you might choose Technovation) for research based data from focus groups. If you get no ‘hits’ you might need to widen the scope of your search (note some journals publish little if any qualitative research). Skim read 3 or 4 of the articles, and select one as an exemplar — 60 minutes. Sumamrise the method (not the content), and evaluate the quality of the focus groups that were undertaken (include a description of the criteria you used for that evaluation, and why you did not chose the other aritcles you skimmed) — 60 minutes. Hint: You might also look at Huff again (e.d., Huff, 2009, pp. 251–268)] Design a focus group session to explore the factors behind the choices of how people travel to work (or university) — 40 minutes. Second class Overview I think we all develop favourite ways of collecting data; and observation (participant or non-participant) is my personal ‘weapon of choice’ when I want to understand what is going on for people. It is also the weapon of choice in the particular research conversation in which I participate: strategy-as-practice. In the case of strategy as practice, it is possible to trace its ‘popularity’ from strategy-as-practice (as exemplified by the works of Jarzabakowsi), back to the process/processual studies of the Warwick group (where Jarzabkowsi did her PhD), to Pettigrew (who was at Warwick for many years)a and his classic work on ICI (The awaking giant, 1985). All this provides a rich hinterland of ‘how to go about’ research in that research conversation. Of course, there are other influences—e.g. Gioia and his method (Gioia, Corley, &amp; Hamilton, 2013)—but, it is key figures in the strategy-as-practice ‘converstation’ who have, to a greater or lesser extent, determined what other methodological influences are seen as appropriate. Over time you should become familiar with the history and trajectory of your particular research conversation. Class plan Any questions? What matters in participant observation? What do we see when we observe? Do we see the same thing? Do we see the same thing? Part 2 What are the challenges of participant observation? What the solution to the need for a quid pro quo? Does going native matter to your conversation? (and what drives that). Prep and tasks Read chapter 11 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 136–150) — 30 minutes. Read the chapter in ‘Social Research: Theory, Methods and Techniques’ on participant observation (Corbetta, 2003) — 30 minutes. Based on the two readings, draw a concept map (look it up if you need to) of the main concepts and their relationship — 30 minutes. Read the methods section of Jarzabkowski’s paper on doing ethnography, where she talks about observations (Jarzabkowski, Bednarek, &amp; Cabantous, 2015) Read the methods section — 30 minutes. How do you know what you are observing? Read “how I learnt what a crock was” (Becker, 1993) — 30 minutes. One issue the previous two readings either allude to, or explicitly address is “How do you know what people are talking about?” In situations where the people you are observing have significantly different knowledge than you—say, software engineers or lawyers—how do you decide what to pay attention to? How do you know when people a making in-jokes? — 10 minutes. Use the SAGE Research methods site to explore this issue, and develop an approach for overcoming this problem — 60 minutes. Lookup the term “Going native” in Dictionary of Statistics &amp; Methodology, and in The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods (both available through the SAGE Research Methods website). In the tradition of your desired research conversation, is going-native seen as problematical? — 60 minutes. Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013), in talking about participant observation, talks about the notion of reciprocity. This issue exists almost all the time in qualitative research; what kind of quid pro quo can you give participants and what danagers might exist. Hint: Think about the notion of free and informed consent (“Guiding principles for conducting research with human participants,” 2013) — 30 minutes.

["w3-details.html", "Chapter 4 Week three First class Second class End of week", " Chapter 4 Week three This week we look at our second qualitative research method, case study research. In some disciplines/sub-fields, case study research is perhaps the most prevalent way of doing research. However, I think it is important not to be side-tracked by the use of cases in teaching (e.g., the Harvard method). Rather, we need to concentrate on case studies as a strategy for doing research. This week sees us rounding out they ways in which with collect data, by considering archival (or secondary data) research. We then transition into the analysis of qualitative data. For many students (and academics), they analysis of the data is the most challenging part of qualitative research. First class Overview I am somewhat biased as I mainly read in my own area (strategizing in professional service firms), and within that milieu the case study reins supreme. So, I perhaps over estimate its importance; but it is a very important methodology. So this week, you will undertake the first steps toward doing a research case study; writing a case-description. Think back to the journal articles where you have seen case descriptions. If you are not sure what a case description is, no worries, you have a task to do this week that will address that. Class plan In what ways are case study research and action research similar? How are units of analysis and levels of analysis related? Review the case studies Prep and tasks For many of these tasks, you will need to engage in some independent research. What is an embedded case? — 10 minutes. What is a concept map? This should be easy as you used looked at them last week — 10 minutes. Given your ontological/epistemological position, draw a concept map that connects the ideas of “unit of analysis” and “level of analysis”. Your concept map should contain citations to the sources of the ideas you present — 30 minutes. Select an empirically-based journal article you have enjoyed (it should be an article with which you are already familiar). Be prepared to present/discuss/describe the units of analysis and level of analysis — 30 minutes. Read Chapter 7 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 73–91) — 60 minutes. Read Chapter 12 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 151–162) — 40 minutes. What is a case description in the context of qualitative research? (Hint, check out Yin’s work) — 10 minutes. Where would you place Yin on a positivist — interpretivist spectrum? Write a short case description. Combine what you know about using documents to collect data, and case study research to write a case description, with a view to investigating focusing on Beca’s internationalisation — 180 minutes. Your are time constrained; you will only be making a initial/draft case. Beca is a New Zealand based engineering consultancy. You may only use secondary (archival) data; you must not do any primary data collection You should consider this to be the exploratory phase of research into how professional service firms internationalise. Spend about one third of your time collecting data, and the rest of it writing the case (mainly as referenced quotes). Keep a research log of what you did and why you did it. Bring your case description (and research log) to class. Second class Overview Qualitative data analysis (QDA): anecdotally, one of the big differences between quantitative research and qualitative research is that, in quantitative research one spends a lot of time at the ‘front-end’ working out what is to be done, and the analysis is relative quick. Whereas, with qualitative research, there is less work at the front-end, but the analysis takes much longer. When talking with masters and PhD students about their research plans, we often end up doubling or tripling the amount of time they set aside to do analysis. In many ways, thematic analysis, is the swiss-army knife of QDA, and so we start our journey with a look at this flexible tool that can be used in a variety of paradigms. The ‘go-to’ references for thematic analysis are by Miles and Huberman (Qualitative data analysis, 1994; The qualitative researcher’s companion, 2002). Many qualitative research methods courses have Miles and Huberman’s work as required reading. Class plan How do you do thematic analysis? Which is the better tool, Dedoose or nVivo? Is your coding the same? Is your coding the same? Is thematic coding essentially positivist, interpretivist, or critical in orientation? Is thematic analysis geared towards a top-down or bottom-up approach? Prep and tasks Read Chapter 13 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 165–181) — 40 minutes. Explore the SAGE Research Methods site and read about thematic analysis — 40 minutes. Summarise ‘thematic analysis’ in a paragraph or two, as if it were to be included in chapter 13 of the Myers’ text book — 40 minutes. Again, using the SAGE Research Methods site search and examine instructions or videos on ‘how’ to do thematic analysis (rather than ‘what’ it is). You might need to use the word “coding” as one of your search terms — 60 minutes. Sign-up for a free account at Dedoose. Spend some time getting familiar with this QDA software by coding the text in Appendix F — 90 minutes. Now, on a PC in one of the labs, do the same thing but try out nVivo — 90 minutes. End of week With the week’s classes behind you, it is time to do your learning journal (Section 1.3 ‐ 60 minutes) and then do your review the learning journals of your peers (Section 1.3 ‐ 60 minutes).

["w4-details.html", "Chapter 5 Week four First class Second class End of week", " Chapter 5 Week four The data collection tools we have explored thus far—interviewing, focus groups, participant and non-participant observation, and document collection—can (and are) fruitfully employed the research methods of action research and case studies. You will find that these tools also have their uses in ethnographic research (this week) and ground theory (next week). Following on from your excursion into thematic analysis, this week you will be taking a deeper dive into hermeneutics and semiotics. However, so far, the course has centred on taking research methods (and various tools of conducting qualitative research) and looking at individual parts; e.g., case studies have been considered somewhat separately to interviewing. Thus far, this has led to a rather general understanding of the topics of the first half of the course. For example, how interviewing fits with something like ethnographic research—in particular—has not been considered. For the remainder of the course, the goal is to start to integrate the components that, until now, we have been treating a separate and distinct. First class Overview In this first week, we obstensively focus on ethnography as a qualitative method. However, the goal in this class is to take a more wholistic stance, and consider a suite of publications arising from group of researchers who collaborated in an ethnographic study. Class plan How is interviewing (in general) different to ethnographic interviewing? What is the reason for those differences? How have Smet/Jarzabkowski and colleagues addressed the adavantages and disadvantages of ethnographic research? Prep and tasks Read Chapter 8 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 92–103) — 30 minutes. Draw a concept map that distinguishes/highlights the differences between interview (as you currently understand it) and ethnographic interviewing (hint: you might find something useful in the Handbook of Ethnography on the SAGE Research Methods website. You should focus on the major features of the two data collection methods, and how those features are connected to one another — 45 minutes. Review the notion of transferability on the SAGE Research Methods website — 30 minutes. Read Smets et al., (Smets, Jarzabkowski, Burke, &amp; Spee, 2015) and the the complimentary article by Jarzabkowski and colleagues (Jarzabkowski et al., 2015). You should concentrate on the methods (data collection and analysis) rather than on the topic of the research — 60 minutes. The quid pro quo of that research was primarily an industry report which can be found at https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/research_showcase/Smets-lloyds/beyond-borders-resinsurance-industry-cass-knowledge.pdf. Skim the report — 15 minutes. Be prepared to answer the following questions regarding the aforementioned research: What was the over-arching research method? How was data collected? How was the data analyses? How much work the academic research probably took? How much work the industry report took? Evaluate the quality of their research. How have they achieved transferability? And any other insights about their approach they went about doing qualitative research in that project — 60 minutes in total. Go to Google Scholar and search for “smets reinsurance”, skim the articles. How many publications (and over what period) can you identify that Smet/Jarzabkowski and colleagues produced from their ethnographic data set? — 30 minutes. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of ethnography research identified by Myers. How do you see those playing out in the work of Smets/Jarzabkowski and colleagues? — 30 minutes. Second class Overview More analysis of qualitative data :) As a result there are less topics for class, and more reviewing how you did the analysis and the results that you produced. In many ways, thematic analysis is one of the most straight forward approaches to analysing qualitative data. But it is not without it limitations, and so we look to hermeneutics and semiotics. Class plan How do hermeneutics and semiotics differ? How does that play out in the results of your analysis? Give the three analsyis techniques you have been exposed to, which do you think is the one you are most likely to use? Prep and tasks Read Chapter 14 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 183–196). Make sure that you track down and read the exemplar discussed on page 191; i.e., Myers (1994) — 75 minutes. Read Chapter 15 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 197–208) — 60 minutes. Read the paper by Barley (1990) on his classic study (1986 which you do not need to read) — 60 minutes. Your final reading is by Denzin (1987) and locates symbolic interactionism—re, Barley—and semiotics. It is dense at times, and you should skip over the bits that do not make sense to you. Focus on the examples of analysis — 45 minutes. Having read about thematic analysis, hermeneutics and semiotics draw a concept map show how they are different from one another (this should help you focus on how they are different in ‘doing’ them as an analysis technique) — 30 minutes.

["w5-details.html", "Chapter 6 Week five First class Second class End of week", " Chapter 6 Week five The final research methods we are looking at is grounded theory. When I last looked on Google Scholar, the seminal work by Glaser and Straus (The discovery of grounded theory, 1967) had nearly 10,000 citation. So, this is a very important strategy in qualitative research. That said, the ideas from grounded theory around the analysis of qualitative data are perhaps even more important. Given that, this week we will focus on grounded theory and practice more coding. First class Overview Our first class of the week will focus on (a) bringing you speed on ‘classical’ grounded theory in its many forms. Class plan Urquhart argues that the choice between “Glaserian or Straussin [grounded theory] — depends on individual researchers and their preferences” (Urquhart, 2017). Which is your preference? How has grounded theory been used in your field? Thinking back to the paper by Smets and his colleagues (Smets et al., 2015), what type of coding do you now think they did? Looking back, what type of coding did you actually do when you first tried thematic analysis of Appendix F (e.g., bottom-up, top-down, middle-range, or thematic)? Regarding your open coding of Appendix F, which of your codes are descriptive and which are analytical? What is your theory of academic work-life balance? Prep and tasks Read Chapter 9 of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 209–220) to get an overview on Grounded Theory — 30 minutes. For the leading two or three journals in your own field, say, entrepreneurship, do a search and see how grounded theory has been used. Be prepared to report back on your findings — 30 minutes Visit the SAGE Research methods website: read chapters 1–3 and chapter 5 of Urquhart’s book (Urquhart, 2017) on grounded theory — 210 minutes. Review the coding by Smets and his colleagues, how would you describe it now (bottom-up, top-down, middle-range, or thematic)? — 30 minutes. Using whichever QDA tool you feel most comfortable with, go back to Appendix F and try open coding it — 30 minutes. Return to the ‘discussion’ on StackExchange Academia on work-life balance re teaching and research. Apply the stages of open, selective, and theoretical coding to it? Start with a general research problem. Draw some diagrams and make a few theoretical notes. Generate some research questions based on your theoretical coding? Can you come up with a theory about academics and work-life balance? — 120 minutes. Second class Overview We now move on to what is often called the Gioia method; a more contemporary expression of many of the ideas of grounded theory. This approach to coding (and reporting results) has become immensely popular of late. Class plan How is the Gioia method related to grounded theory? To what extent do the exemplars of the Gioia method that you have read, achieve rigour? To what extent do the exemplars of the Gioia method that you have read, achieve transferability? What lessons do you take away about presenting qualitative research, in general? What lessons do you take away about presenting qualitative research, vis-á-vis your work on academic work-life balance? (To be effective, you will need to show your ‘Gioia’ write-up) Prep and tasks Read the paper by Gioia and his co-authors on the ‘Gioia method’ (Gioia et al., 2013) — 30 minutes. Draw a concept map linking the key tenets of the Gioia method to grounded theory? — 15 minutes. Review the article by Gioia and Thomas (1996)—it one of Gioia’s exemplars and was published in one of the leading quantitative journals, which is quite an achievement for a piece of qualitative research. How closely do Gioia and Thomas follow the Gioia method? — 45 minutes. If you are not familiar with the idea of sensemaking, there is a nice/short literature review by Brown et al. (Brown, Colville, &amp; Pye, 2015). The paper by Anand et al. (Anand, Gardner, &amp; Morris, 2007), is also one of the exemplars cited by Gioia et al, (2013). Review the paper and evaluate how close it follows Gioia’s method — 45 minutes. For the exemplars you have read assess their transferability. Do you agree with the stance taken by Gioia et al (2013)? — 30 minutes. For a third time, return to the ‘discussion’ on StackExchange Academia on work-life balance re teaching and research (https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/89362/how-do-academics-with-teaching-responsibilities-etc-find-the-time-to-do-researc), which you should be rather familiar now, and apply the Gioia method. Write-up your results following the advice of Gioia et al. (2013) — 120 minutes.

["w6-details.html", "Chapter 7 Week six First class Second class End of week", " Chapter 7 Week six First class Overview As we head into the ‘home stretch’ of the course, and the topic of ‘Presenting your research’ it is tempting to think that we have come to the end of the research process; the data has been collected, analysed, and all that is left is to present our findings. Alas, it is often the case that in writing-up our work, we find that we need new literature, extra data, more analysis. Writing up can often be the trigger for further iterations through the research cycle. It is not unusual, having submitted a piece of work that we thought was ‘perfectly fine’, to have reviewers ask for “an additional comparative case”, or for the inclusion of a particular piece of literature that then means additional interviews have to be done. It is also the case that there are few researchers who haven’t been told “There are two papers here”, or “Your research question needs some work”, resulting in almost new papers being written. So, writing-up is not always the end. Even so, as your summative learning journal looms large on the horizon, the plan for this week is relatively light to allow you to focus on that task. Class plan Reflecting on the readings by Gioia and Jarzabkowski, what is their impact on how you think about qualitative research design? What tools and techniques from the course will you use in completing your summative learning journal? What lessons from Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 221–250) will you bring through to your summative learning journal? What question do you have about your summative learning? ‘Pair and share’ the outlines of your summative learning journal. What actionable feedback can you give to help your colleagues? Prep and tasks Read “Part IV” of Myers (Qualitative research in business &amp; management, 2013, pp. 221–250) — 30 minutes. List two or three ideas from this reading, that you will apply to your summative learning journal — 10 minutes. Discuss the idea that, “As used in this course, a summative learning journal is a form of auto-ethnography”. — 30 minutes. Discuss the question, “Does an auto-ethnographic study require approval from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee?” — 20 minutes. There are many papers on presenting your research. These often spill over into how you should collect and analyse your data. You have already read one by Gioia et al. (2013). Review the paper by Jarazabkowski and her colleagues on producing persausive findings (Jarzabkowski, Bednarek, &amp; Lê, 2014). How do papers like these shape how you intend to present your summative learning journal ? — 90 minutes. Write a detailed outline (not a draft, unless you are feeling ambitious) of your summative learning journal and bring it to class — 180 minutes. Second class Overview This class is dedicated to your summative learning journals. If you have no question or concerns, can consider spending the time working on your final piece of work. Class plan Foreshadowing your summative learning journals, what are your big takeaways? Wrapping it up Class party? (Class lunch?) Prep and tasks Do more revisions/iterations on your summative learning journal — 360 minutes. End of week The course is pretty much over now. All you need to do now is polish up your summative learning journal (Section 1.5) — 120 minutes. "],

They communicate to current and potential students and faculty, employers, the community, and other academic institutions the qualities that The University of Auckland seeks to impart to, or foster in, its graduates. The Graduate Profiles that have been developed are for: (i) Postgraduate Coursework Graduates; (ii) Postgraduate Research Graduates (masters level or equivalent); and (iii) Doctoral Graduates. The University of Auckland is committed to provide an educational experience of the highest standards to its students. In addition, The University of Auckland recognises the needs of a diverse and multi-cultural student population, including its special responsibility under Te Tiriti o Waitangi / The Treaty of Waitangi. The implementation of the Graduate Profiles rests with the faculties, departments, and other teaching and learning support divisions of the University, which may develop more specific profiles that are suitable for their subject fields and/or student population. As the student learning environment changes, the Graduate Profiles will be reviewed. A.2 Description The following six themes represent the capabilities that the Business School seeks to foster in all of its graduates. The development of these capabilities does not come all at once, but rather is expected to build from year to year. Each course is not expected to contribute to all capabilities, but each course will have its own goals and learning outcomes that relate to the overall development of this profile. Disciplinary knowledge and practice: Graduates will be able to apply highly specialised knowledge within the discipline to demonstrate an advanced awareness and understanding in a global context. Critical thinking: Graduates will be able to analyse and evaluate the relevant literature, and design and develop scholarly arguments that demonstrate advanced and diverse thinking. Solution seeking: Graduates will be able to creatively research and analyse complex issues, and develop innovative solutions. Communication and engagement: Graduates will be able to engage, communicate, and collaborate with diverse groups using multiple formats and effectively address a range of professional and academic audiences. Independence and integrity: Graduates will be able to demonstrate advanced independent thought, self- reflection, ethics, and integrity. Social and environmental responsibility: Graduates will consider, in relation to their discipline, the potential significance of the principles underpinning both the Treaty of Waitangi and sustainability.

["course-design.html", "B Course design B.1 My teaching and your learning", " B Course design B.1 My teaching and your learning My approach to teaching is shaped by three concerns. First, “What is it that I want you to be able to do at the end of the course?” What skills, knowledge, and attitudes am I seeking to engender—what do I hope you will have learn? This is articulated through the learning outcomes for the course. When I talk of learning, I following Terry Doyle, in that: Learning is the ability to use information after a significant period of disuse and It is the ability to use the information to solve problems in a context different (if only slightly) from the context in which the information was originally learnt. In a nutshell, I want you to be able apply what you have learnt here to your own (future) research project(s). My second concern is “What is the best use of our time together?”. Implicitly, this also addresses the use of your individual study time). The result of this concern is a preference for a ‘flipped’ classroom, where delivery of the content of the course takes place outside of the classroom, and where time in the classroom is spent working with that content to refining your understanding. Finally, “What are effective ways of learning?” As noted earlier, praticing something is one way to become more accomplished at it. That process can be accelerated by engaging in explicit reflection of ones practice(s), on your ‘doings’ and ‘sayings’ (Schatzki, Knorr Cetina, &amp; Savigny, 2001). "],

Many—and maybe even most—universities offer qualitative research methods course. There are also a plethora of textbooks on the subject. Then, there are a wide array of on-line resources; videos, web pages, and so on. So, there has to be a question about why re-invent the wheel. Part of the answer is about fitting the needs of our students as they head into their dissertations and theses. Part of the answer is, that I have tried to avoid reinventing anything. To that end, this course is the result of the input of many people including Brigid Carroll, Michael Myers, Cathy Urquhart, Margarita Mooney, and Ann Langley; drawing on existing expertise and resources. And so. I have tried to take their advice and ideas and synthesis something that is a good fit for students in Management &amp; International Business, here at the University of Auckland. C.2 The history of the course Research has been taught in this department, at a postgraduate level, for at least 20 years that I know of. In 1997, there were two courses, Research Methods I and II, that sought to “ensure that all … master’s students have the basic research skills and concepts to enable them to do a master’s thesis”. By 2000, the courses had morphed into on the Foundations of Research, addressing the “theory and philosophy of social science research methods” and Research Practice, focusing on “applying research methods in organisational contexts”. With the change from being MGMT courses to BUSINESS courses, the focus of became something that would be familiar to current students, a courses on Research design, Qualitative research, and Quantitative research. In 2017 the Advanced qualitative research and Advanced qualitative research courses were introduced to address the different needs that PhD candidates have, in comparison to the needs of masters students doing a dissertation or a 120-point thesis.

D.1 Introduction The purpose of this Participant Information Sheet, and the important information it contains is to provide you with enough detail so you can make an informed decision about taking part in the research activities in BUSINESS 705. The goal here is one of informed consent; that is good ethics practice. If you review the course’s learning objectives, you will see that participating in the research activities of the course will lead to you becoming a better qualitative researcher, and to better understand the implications of doing qualitative research. That is the goal of the research activities in class. If having read everything here, you decide this is not the course for you, as with any course, you can withdraw from the course without penalty for the first two weeks. In that case, you should contact either the MCom advisor or the BComHons advisor to find an alternative methods course. Note, that if you are planning to do BUSINESS 712 (Advanced Qualitative Methods), the timing of that course may mean you will not be able to do it this semester (remember, BUSINESS 705 is in the first half of this semester, and BUSINESS 712 is in the second half of the semester). D.2 Research in BUSINESS 705 There is an old saw says that practice makes perfect. As this course is about qualitative research methods—and in particular, about preparing you to undertake your own research in the future—an important part of this course is actually doing the stuff of qualitative research. To build your skills in this area, you will practice common qualitative research techniques. For example, you will design an interview guide and then conduct interviews using that guide. More formally, you will act as an investigator and actually use the tools of qualitative research to collect data from your classmates; this implies that you will also act as a participant when it is the turn of your classmates to act as investigators. As a participant, you need to be fully informed about the consequences of your participation in the research activities that will take place within the BUSINESS 705 classroom. In what follows, the research activities that will take place in BUSINESS 705 are explained. To be explicit, you—and your classmates—will be the ones carrying out the research procedures (e.g., conducting the interviews). Peter, your lecturer, is there to help and assist, but not to ‘do’; he is not collecting any research data. D.3 The nature of your participation As described in the section on Assessments (in the course guide), a significant method of assessing your learning is through a reflective learning journal, centered the nature of your learning about qualitative research methods. Such work has auto-ethnographical components, and so is a form of participant observation that combines the roles of investigator and participant. Thus, being both an investigator and as a participant are integral parts of this course. Your enrollment in this course is taken as implicit consent to this. As part of your work in the class you will be party to, and participate in: Participant and non-participant observations Interviews Focus groups Given that you will be doing participant observation, everything that you, and your peers, do and say in the class—either formally or informally—may become data. At times your participation may be recorded (either by video or by digital audio). This is so you can compare and contrast the impact of recording (versus note taking) both from the perspective of the participant and that of the investigator. Such recordings will not be kept; at the end of the class they will be deleted. Even so, you should assume that everything you do and say in the class may be recorded; as novice researchers, it is possible that someone (when acting as an investigator) neglects to notify participants that they are being recorded. At any time—without giving any reason—you may: Withdraw from participation Elect not to be recorded If you opt-out you will be given alternative work to do (typically involving readings and videos from the SAGE Research Methods website). It is not possible to replicate the learning that comes from ‘doing’ and so if you do opt-out you will have a qualitatively different experience and probably a different type of learning. D.4 Purpose of the research The primary purpose of the research activities in BUSINESS 705 is to give you and your peers the opportunity to practice techniques of qualitative research. There is no intent on Peter’s part that the data collected will lead to a published output, say, a journal article. The overarching topic that frames activities in which you will participate in is “My learning of qualitative research methods”. D.5 Location of the research You will only be acting as a participant during the scheduled class time of BUSINESS 705. D.6 Confidentiality Given the nature of the class, it is not possible to promise confidentiality around either your participation in general or your data in particular. Your classmates will know that you are ‘in the class’, they will see, for example, the interviews in which you participate, and thus everyone in the class will—to some degree or other—have access to the data that is elicited from one other. Furthermore, other people not in the class will know that you have (mostly like) participated in the research activities in the class; e.g., administrative staff with access to details of the course on Canvas. D.7 Potential risks Give the topic of the research activities, and the nature of those research activities, it is anticipated that there are no potential risks of significance that are materially different from any other class where you might be required to keep a learning journal or other reflective pieces of work. D.8 Data retention You should be aware that the data collected by your peers may be retained by them (as part of their learning journals) indefinitely. As noted earlier, electronic recordings are to be deleted at the end of the classes in which they are made. D.9 If you have questions or concerns If you have any queries about what is discussed here, you can email me, phone me, visit me in my office, or talk to me in class.

["engineering.html", "F The historical roots of engineering", " F The historical roots of engineering The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the historical context from which a variety of engineering disciplines have emerged. The compilation of any history of engineering requires the researcher to make choices as to what is, and what is not, included. This applies as much to the selection of which disciplines of engineering to review, as to the events and pressures that shaped the profession. Consequently, this history does not address the role of engineers in, for instance, nuclear engineering or microelectronics. Instead, the disciplines with greater relevance to Arlington are emphasised. Such editing is a necessity of space and time. The etymology of engineer is found in the notion of one who does something ingenious (Oxford University Press, 1989); that is, “a person possessing an innovative mind and skilful hands”, an “ingeniator” (Harms, 2004, p. 3). Though some engineers, trace their heritage as ingeniators to prehistoric tool making (Harms, 2004), it is during the Renaissance (circa 1300–1699), that the beginning of modern engineering becomes more apparent (Garrison, 1998). During that time, engineers adopted mathematical methods to tackle a variety of problems such as statics (the mechanics of rigid bodies), ballistics, and topographical surveying. They drew on systematic empirical investigation and adopted scientific language (Armytage, 1976; Garrison, 1998; Norrie, 1956). The use of mathematical methods, together with the adoption of scientific method marks, the transition of engineering from an occupation based on artisanship towards one more resembling the modern profession. During the seventeenth and eighteen centuries, engineers progressively formalised their training. Until about 1760, most engineering was associated with governmental works including “the constructional requirements of … dockyards and harbours, of land fortifications and of roads built for the better travel of troops rather than for civil needs” (Norrie, 1956, p. 6). The need for such military engineering led to the establishment of the French corps of engineers. The formation of the Corps de Ponts et Chaussées (of bridges and roads) in 1716 was followed by the founding of an engineering school, L’École des Ponts et Chaussées in 1747 (Armytage, 1976). The creation of this school was followed a by number of others and it became the model for L’École Polytechnique both in and beyond France (Garrison, 1998). The academic leadership of French engineering led to the publication of the first civil engineering reference books. Two of the most notable are Science des Ingénieurs in 1729 and Architecture Hydraulique in 1737. The first of these were in print for over one-hundred years (Norrie, 1956). Engineers were also involved in the formation of professional societies. In England, a meeting in 1660 to discuss “the founding of a colledge for the promoting of Physico-Mathematicall Experimentall Learning” culminated in the creation of the Royal Society in 1662 (Armytage, 1976, p. 77). During the eighteenth century, the meaning of engineer grew to encompass those undertaking civil works. The applications of civil engineering included the construction of canals, bridges, and wharves (Garrison, 1998). John Smeaton, the builder of the Eddystone Lighthouse, founded the Society for Civil Engineers in 1771. The Smeatonian Society, as it was sometimes called, the first of its kind, was an expression of the professional interests of its members in civil engineering (Norrie, 1956). It led to the establishment of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1818 and, in turn, to the first English school of engineering in 1827 at King’s College in London (Norrie, 1956). In America, civil engineers created their professional society, the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects, in 1852. Aside from civil engineering, other engineering specialisations arose. Mechanical engineers were at the forefront of the industrial revolution (Garrison, 1998). They brought their knowledge and skill to improving waterpower and to the development of steam power. Alongside these advances, engineers created new processes for manufacturing iron and steel. Mining engineers, in expediting the supply of coal and iron ore, facilitated this. Mass-production of iron and steel, together with steam power, enabled the creation of much of the of transportation infrastructure in the form of steamships and railways (Garrison, 1998). With the expansion of the railways came greater demand for bridges, often constructed from the new mass-produced iron and steel. The rise of the steamship also produced the new engineering discipline of naval engineering (Armytage, 1976). These new engineers drew on the practices of other engineering disciplines. For example, similar to bridge designers, they utilised physical models to predict more accurately the performance of their designs using a combination of mathematics, experimentation, and intuition. In Germany, a new breed of engineers, chemical engineers, were advancing industrial chemistry (Armytage, 1976; Harms, 2004). The variety of products produced by chemical engineering include dyes, drugs, explosives, acids, organic chemicals and other “fine chemicals” (Garrison, 1998). Nevertheless, engineers were not concerned solely with commerce; epidemiological studies in the mid-1800s highlighted the necessity of potable water supplies and separate sewage disposal resulting in the emergence of sanitary and hydraulic engineers. The first electrical engineers also appeared during this period. The work of Michael Faraday, André-Marie Ampere, and others, led to the emergence, and widespread distribution, of the electrical industry (Garrison, 1998). Innovations such as electric lighting, the telegraph, and the accompanying electrification of cities changed the way people worked and lived. Power for the new electrical networks came from steam turbines or from waterpower. For example, in 1893, Westinghouse won the contract to build generators powered by the water from Niagara Falls. Such large-scale projects necessitated the effort of many engineers across many specialisations, working together with those contracted for construction. During the nineteenth century, there were significant changes in the way that construction was undertaken. Until that time, casual labour was utilised to undertake public works. However, those who funded such works increasingly sought “binding commitments to cover all the risks and responsibilities of construction” (Norrie, 1956, p. 89) and guarantees against contractors failing to complete the contracted work. As a result, contractors changed from being simple suppliers of organised labour to “men of greater calibre to carry the executive burden” (Norrie, 1956, p. 89). As British engineers and navvies were employed overseas, the new contracting methods spread to France and beyond. Contracting for construction work developed into a project-based business. Even in the early days the “contractor’s assets could generally be easily realized and a business be wound up without undue loss, and many with good profits took advantage of this” (Norrie, 1956, p. 97). One result of the move to contracting was that for any project there were often three parties involved: the client, who would fund the project; the engineer who would do the design work; and the contractor, who would actually build the project, often under the partial supervision of the engineer. Such tripartite arrangements predominate even to this day. The traditional approach is for the client to select a designer (an engineering firm or an architectural firm) and a contractor (who will actual build what is designed) through a process of competitive bidding (Beard, Loulakis, &amp; Wundram, 2001). If multiple forms of design work are required, such as structural engineering and fire engineering, then a lead design firm may tender for the work in conjunction with other, subcontracted, firms. Similarly, if the construction of the project requires multiple contractors, a lead contractor will engage sub-contractors and sub-trades as necessary. This process is known as the design-bid-build project delivery method. The twentieth century saw the rise of new forms of engineering, including petroleum engineering, aeronautical or aerospace engineering, electronic engineering, biomedical engineering, and other specialties. Classification of engineers, such as mechanical or civil engineers, is illustrative of how engineering is associated with the classes of devices they produce (Harms, 2004). For the purpose of this thesis, the major categorisations of contemporary engineering are civil, mechanical, electrical, structural, water, material, surveying, transportation, urban, and industrial.
