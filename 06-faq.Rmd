# Frequently asked questions {#faq}

## Can I miss class? {-}

Yes, but there are consequences. Missing a class will:

* limit your learning and thus the quality of your weekly learning journal
* reduce your opportunity to obtain participation marks


## What about late assignments {-}

The way tasks and assessments are scheduled, together with the
compressed nature of the course, means that there is little wiggle
room for late assignments. E.g., If you do not get a weekly learning
journal in on time, one consequence is that no-one will be allocated
to provide you feedback on it, and you will not be allocated any
learning journals on which to provide. That will cost you marks.
