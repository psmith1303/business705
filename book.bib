   abstract = {Given the fast pace of change confronting managers today, it is critical that they develop capacities to learn from current work situations and adapt this learning to new situations. This need is driven by elaborate techniques and new processes that emerge regularly—initiatives that often require corporate-wide behavioral changes beginning at the top of the organization. In the midst of these time-consuming and expensive initiatives lies the simple and time-tested tool of reflection. To use it effectively, managers need only recognize that it has value, then create an amazingly small amount of time and structure for it to take place. With this process, managers take responsibility for their own learning—a responsibility that is, in some cases, too quickly turned over to workshop leaders, university professors, or consultants. No matter how qualified these educational providers may be, it is unlikely that any of them could create case studies with greater relevance or challenge than a manager's own work experiences.},

Our goal for the symposium was to increase management scholars’ sensitivity to the importance of theory–method “fit” in qualitative research. We have integrated the panelists’ prepared remarks and interactive discussion into three sections: an introduction by each scholar, who articulates her or his own approach to qualitative research; their personal reflections on the similarities and differences between approaches to qualitative research; and answers to general questions posed by the audience during the symposium. We conclude by summarizing insights gleaned from the symposium about important distinctions among these three qualitative research approaches and their appropriate usages.},

   abstract = {Ethnography has often been seen as the province of the lone researcher; however, increasingly management scholars are examining global phenomena, necessitating a shift to global team-based ethnography. This shift presents some fundamental methodological challenges, as well as practical issues of method, that have not been examined in the literature on organizational research methods. That is the focus of this article. We first outline the methodological implications of a shift from single researcher to team ethnography, and from single case site to the multiple sites that constitute global ethnography. Then we present a detailed explanation of a global team-based ethnography that we conducted over three years. Our study of the global reinsurance industry involved a team of five ethnographers conducting fieldwork in 25 organizations across 15 countries. We outline three central challenges we encountered: team division of labour, team sharing and constructing a global ethnographic object. The article concludes by suggesting that global team-based ethnography provides important insights into global phenomena, such as regulation, finance and climate change among others, that are of interest to management scholars.},

Paul's writings provide ideas for future research on self-regulated learning.

First, we shift focus away from structural and relatively static organizational responses to institutional complexity and identify three balancing mechanisms--segmenting, bridging, and demarcating--that allow individuals to manage competing logics and their shifting salience within their everyday work. Second, we integrate these mechanisms in a theoretical model that explains how individuals can continually keep coexisting logics, and their tendencies to either blend or disconnect, in a state of dynamic tension that renders them conflicting-yet-complementary logics. Our model shows how actors are able to dynamically balance coexisting logics, maintaining the distinction between them while also exploiting the benefits of their interdependence. Third, in contrast to most studies of newly formed hybrids and/or novel complexity, our focus on a long-standing context of institutional complexity shows how institutional complexity can itself become institutionalized and routinely enacted within everyday practice.},
