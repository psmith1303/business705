# Week six {#w6-details}

## First class {-}

### Overview {-}

As we head into the 'home stretch' of the course, and the topic of
'Presenting your research' it is tempting to think that we have come
to the end of the research process; the data has been collected,
analysed, and all that is left is to present our findings. Alas, it is
often the case that in writing-up our work, we find that we need new
literature, extra data, more analysis. Writing up can often be the
trigger for further iterations through the research cycle. It is not
unusual, having submitted a piece of work that we thought was
'perfectly fine', to have reviewers ask for "an additional comparative
case", or for the inclusion of a particular piece of literature than
means additional interviews have to be done; there are few researchers
who haven't been told "There are two papers here", or "Your research
question needs some work", resulting in almost new papers being
written.

So, writing-up is not always the end. 

Even so, as your summative learning journal looms large on the
horizon, the plan for this week is relatively light to allow you to
focus on task.

### Class plan {-}

* Reflecting on the readings by Gioia and Jarzabkowski, what is their
  impact on how you think about qualitative research design?

* What question do you have about your summative learning, ?

* What lessons from Myers [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness
   p. 221--250] will you bring through to your summative learning
   journal?

* Pair and share your summative learning journals. What actionable
  feedback can you give to help your colleagues?

### Prep and tasks {-}

1. Read "Part IV" of Myers [-@myers_2013_qualitativeresearchbusiness
   p. 221--250] &mdash; 30 minutes.
   
   - *List* two or three ideas from this reading, that you will apply to
     your summative learning journal &mdash; 10 minutes.
	 
2. *Discuss* the idea that, "As used in this course, a summative
   learning journal is a form of auto-ethnography". &mdash; 30 minutes.
   
3. *Discuss* the question, "Does an auto-ethnographic study require
   approval from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics
   Committee?" &mdash; 20 minutes.

4. There are many papers on presenting your research. These often
   spill over into how you should collect and analyse your data. Read
   the papers on the Gioia method
   [@gioia_2013_seekingqualitativerigor] and on presenting field notes
   [@jarzabkowski_2015_conductingglobalteambased] &mdash 120 minutes.
   

5. Write a detailed outline of your summative learning journal and
   bring it to class &mdash; 180 minutes.

## Second class {-}

### Overview {-}

This class is focused on your summative learning journals. If you have no question or concerns, can consider spending the time working on your final piece of work.

### Class plan {-}

* Forshadowing your summative learning journals, what are your big take aways?

* Wrapping it up

### Prep and tasks {-}

1. Do more revisions/iterations on your summative learning journal
   &mdash; 360 minutes.


## End of week {-}

The course is pretty much over now. All you need to do now is polish
up your summative learning journal (Section \@ref(ass3)) &mdash; 120
minutes.
